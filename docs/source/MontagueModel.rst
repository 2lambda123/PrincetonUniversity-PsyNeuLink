Montague Model
==============

This implements a model of the mesolimbic dopamine cell activity during monkey
conditioning as found in `Montague, Dayan, and Sejnowski (1996).

The plots below were generated by PsyNeuLink. The original plots can be found 
in Figures 5A-C in the original paper.

The first plot shows ∂(t) over time for three trials during 
training. In PsyNeuLink, ∂(t) is the output of the 
`PredictionErrorMechanism <PredictionErrorMechanism>`, which is 
created automatically by 
`LearningProjections <LearningProjection>` called with 
`TDLearning <TDLearning>` as its learning function.

The second plot shows ∂(t) over all 100 trials of the model responses.

The third plot demonstrates extinction of response to the stimulus by 
non-delivery of the reward after trial 70.

Plots 1 and 2 can be generated by running the function 
`montague_model_training()` in `MontagueModel.py`. Plot 3 
can be generated by running the function `montague_model_response_extinction()` 
also in `MontagueModel.py`. All three plots can be generated by running 
`python MontagueModel` from the command line or `%run MontagueModel.py` inside 
a Jupyter notebook or from the iPython shell.
