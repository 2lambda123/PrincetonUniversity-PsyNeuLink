Overview
--------

An LCMechanism is a `ControlMechanism <ControlMechanism>` that multiplicatively modulates the `function
<Mechanism_Base.function>` of one or more `Mechanisms <Mechanism>` (usually `TransferMechanisms <TransferMechanism>`).
It implements an abstract model of the `locus coeruleus (LC)  <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12371518>`_ that,
by default, uses an `FHNIntegrator` Function to generate its output.  This is modulated by a `mode <LCMechanisms.mode>`
parameter that regulates its functioning between `"tonic" and "phasic" modes of operation
<LCMechanism_Modes_Of_Operation>`.  The Mechanisms modulated by an LCMechanism can be listed using
its `show <LCMechanism.show>` method.
COMMENT:
The LCMechanism is used by the `AGTComposition` to implement a form of the
`Adaptive Gain Theory  <http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.neuro.28.061604.135709>`_ of the locus
coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system.

.. _LCMechanism_Creation:

Creating an LCMechanism
-----------------------

An LCMechanism can be created in any of the ways that a `ControlMechanism <ControlMechanism_Creation>` is created.
Like all ControlMechanisms, it receives its `input <LCMechanism_Input>` from an ObjectiveMechanism specified in the
**objective_mechanism** argument of the LCMechanism's constructor in one of two ways:  by specifying an existing
ObjectiveMechanism, or the OutputStates from which it should receive its input(s) (see
`ControlMechanism_ObjectiveMechanism` for details).  These inputs, transformed by the ObjectiveMechanism, drive
the LCMechanism's `phasic response <LCMechanism_Modes_Of_Operation>`.  By default, the LCMechanism creates an
ObjectiveMechanism with InputStates that are constrained to be scalar values, and that generates the
logistically-transformed sum of these values as its output (see `LCMechanism_ObjectiveMechanism`). However, this can be
customized by specifying an ObjectiveMechanism in the **object_mechanism** argument, and a custom function in the
ObjectiveMechanism's **function** argument, so long as the function generates a scalar as its result (see XXX for an
example [XXXGET FROM EVCMechanism).  The OutputStates used to drive the LCMechanism's response can be specified either
directly in the **objective_mechanism** argument of its constructor (if the LCMechanism's default ObjectiveMechanism
is to be used), or in the **monitored_output_states** argument of the constructor for a custom ObjectiveMechanism if
that is used.  The `Mechanisms <Mechanism>` the LCMechanism controls are specified in the **modulated_mechanisms**
argument of its constructor (see `LCMechanism_Modulate`).  It's **mode** argument is used to specify either a default
value for its `mode <LCMechanism.mode>` attribute, or another `ControlMechanism` used to control it.

.. _LCMechanism_ObjectiveMechanism

   By default, the ObjectiveMechanism is assigned a CombineMeans Function that takes the mean of the `value
   <InputState.value>` received from each OutputState specified in **monitored_output_states** (i.e., of each of its
   `input_states <ObjectiveMechanism.input_states>`) and sums these; the result is provided as the input to the LCMechanism.
   The contribution of each monitored_output_state can be weighted and/or exponentitaed in the standard way for the
       monitored_output_states/input_states of an ObjectiveMechanism


.. _LCMechanism_Modulate:

Specifying Mechanisms to Modulate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Mechanisms to be modulated by an LCMechanism are specified in its **modulated_mechanisms** argument. An LCMechanism
controls a `Mechanism <Mechanism>` by modifying the `multiplicative_param <Function_Modulatory_Params>` of the
Mechanism's `function <TransferMechanism.function>`.  Therefore, any Mechanism specified for control by an LCMechanism
must be either a `TransferMechanism`, or a Mechanism that uses a `TransferFunction` or a class of `Function <Function>`
that implements a `multiplicative_param <Function_Modulatory_Params>`.  The **modulate_mechanisms** argument must be a
list of such Mechanisms.  The keyword *ALL* can also be used to specify all of the eligible `ProcessMechanisms
<ProcessingMechanism>` in all of the `Compositions <Composition>` to which the LCMechanism belongs.  If a Mechanism
specified in the **modulated_mechanisms** argument does not implement a multiplicative_param, it is ignored. A
`ControlProjection` is automatically created that projects from the LCMechanism to the `ParameterState` for the
`multiplicative_param <Function_Modulatory_Params>` of every Mechanism specified in the **modulated_mechanisms**
argument (and listed in its `modulated_mechanisms <LCMechanism.modulated_mechanisms>` attribute).


.. _LCMechanism_Monitored_OutputStates:

Specifying OutputStates to Monitor for Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the **mode** argument is specified in the LCMechanism's constructor, it automatically creates an `LCController` (as
its `ControlMechanism`) and associated `UtilityIntegratorMechanism` (as its `ObjectiveMechanism`) that are used to
monitor and evaluate the `value <OutputState.value>` of the `OutputStates <OutputState>` specified, and regulate the
value of the LCMechanism's `mode <LCMechanism.mode>` attribute (see `LCMechanism_Modes_Of_Operation`). The **mode**
argument must be a list, each item of which must refer to a `Mechanism <Mechanism>` or the `OutputState` of one.
These are assigned to the `monitored_output_states <UtilityIntegratorMechanism>` attribute of the
UtilityIntegratorMechanism, and to the same attribute of the LCController and the LCMechanism itself. The
UtilityIntegratorMechanism is assigned to the `objective_mechanism <LCController.objective_mechanism>` attribute,
as well as that of the LCMechanism.  Finally, the LCController is assigned as the `controller
<LCMechanism.controller>` attribute of the LCMechanism.

.. _LCMechanism_Structure:

Structure
---------

.. _LCMechanism_Input:

Input
~~~~~

An LCMechanism has a single (primary) `InputState <InputState_Primary>` that receives Projections from any Mechanisms
specified in the **input_states** argument of the LCMechanism's constructor;  its `value <InputState.value>` is a
scalar, so the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter for any MappingProjection to the LCMechanism's InputState
from an OutputStates with a `value <OutputState.value>` that is an array of greater than length 1 is assigned a
`FULL_CONNECTIVITY_MATRIX`.  The `value <InputState.value>` of the LCMechanism's InputState is used as the `variable
<FHNIntegrator.variable>` for the LCMechanism's `function <LCMechanism.function>`.

.. _LCMechanism_Function:

Function
~~~~~~~~

XXX ADD MENTION OF allocation_policy HERE

An LCMechanism uses the `FHNIntegrator` as its `function <LCMechanism.function`; this implements a `FitzHugh-Nagumo
model <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FitzHughâ€“Nagumo_model>`_ often used to describe the spiking of a neuron,
but in this case the population activity of the LC (see `Gilzenrat et al.,
<2002https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12371518>`_). The `FHNIntegrator` Function takes the `input
<LCMechanism_Input>` to the LCMechanism as its `variable <FHNIntegrator.variable>`, and uses the LCMechanism's `mode
<LCMechanism.mode>` attribute as the value of its `mode <FHNIntegrator.mode>` parameter.

.. _LCMechanism_Modes_Of_Operation:

LC Modes of Operation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The LCMechanism's `mode <LCMechanism.mode>` attribute regulates its function between `"tonic" and "phasic" modes
of operation <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8027789>`_:

  * in the *tonic mode* (low value of `mode <LCMechanism.mode>`), the output of the LCMechanism is moderately low
    and constant; that is, it is relatively unaffected by its `input <LCMechanism_Input`.  This blunts the response
    of the Mechanisms that the LCMechanism controls to their inputs.

  * in the *phasic mode* (high value of `mode <LCMechanism.mode>`), when the `input to the LC <LC_Input>` is low,
    its `output <LC_Output>` is even lower than when it is in the tonic regime, and thus the response of the
    Mechanisms it controls to their outputs is even more blunted.  However, when the LCMechanism's input rises above
    a certain value (determined by the `threshold <LCMechanism.threshold>` parameter), its output rises sharply,
    producing a much sharper response of the Mechanisms it controls to their inputs.

If the **mode** argument of the LCMechanism's constructor is specified, the following Components are also
automatically created and assigned to the LCMechanism when it is created:

    * an `LCController` -- takes the output of the UtilityIntegratorMechanism (see below) and uses this to
      control the value of the LCMechanism's `mode <LCMechanism.mode>` attribute.  It is assigned a single
      `ControlSignal` that projects to the `ParameterState` for the LCMechanism's `mode <LCMechanism.mode>` attribute.
    ..
    * a `UtilityIntegratorMechanism` -- monitors the `value <OutputState.value>` of any `OutputStates <OutputState>`
      specified in the **mode** argument of the LCMechanism's constructor;  these are listed in the LCMechanism's
      `monitored_output_states <LCMechanism.monitored_output_states>` attribute, as well as that attribute of the
      UtilityIntegratorMechanism and LCController.  They are evaluated by the UtilityIntegratorMechanism's
      `UtilityIntegrator` Function, the result of whch is used by the LCControl to control the value of the
      LCMechanism's `mode <LCMechanism.mode>` attribute.
    ..
    * `MappingProjections <MappingProjection>` from Mechanisms or OutputStates specified in **monitor_for_control** to
      the UtilityIntegratorMechanism's `primary InputState <InputState_Primary>`.
    ..
    * a `MappingProjection` from the UtilityIntegratorMechanism's *UTILITY_SIGNAL* `OutputState
      <UtilityIntegratorMechanism_Structure>` to the LCMechanism's *MODE* <InputState_Primary>`.
    ..
    * a `ControlProjection` from the LCController's ControlSignal to the `ParameterState` for the LCMechanism's
      `mode <LCMechanism.mode>` attribute.

.. _LCMechanism_Output:

Output

COMMENT:
VERSION FOR SINGLE ControlSignal
An LCMechanism has a single `ControlSignal` used to modulate the function of the Mechanism(s) listed in its
`modulated_mechanisms <LCMechanism.modulated_mechanisms>` attribute.  The ControlSignal is assigned a
`ControlProjection` to the `ParameterState` for the `multiplicative_param <Function_Modulatory_Params>` of the
`function <Mechanism_Base.function>` for each of those Mechanisms.
COMMENT

An LCMechanism has a `ControlSignal` for each Mechanism listed in its `modulated_mechanisms
<LCMechanism.modulated_mechanisms>` attribute.  All of its ControlSignals are assigned the same value:  the result of
the LCMechanism's `function <LCMechanism.function>`.  Each ControlSignal is assigned a `ControlProjection` to the
`ParameterState` for the  `multiplicative_param <Function_Modulatory_Params>` of `function
<Mechanism_Base.function>` for the Mechanism in `modulated_mechanisms <LCMechanism.modulate_mechanisms>` to which it
corresponds. The Mechanisms modulated by an LCMechanism can be displayed using its :func:`show <LCMechanism.show>`
method.

.. _LCMechanism_Examples:

Examples
~~~~~~~~

The following example generates an LCMechanism that modulates the function of two TransferMechanisms, one that uses
a `Linear` function and the other a `Logistic` function::

    my_mech_1 = TransferMechanism(function=Linear,
                                  name='my_linear_mechanism')
    my_mech_2 = TransferMechanism(function=Logistic,
                                  name='my_logistic_mechanism')

    LC = LCMechanism(modulated_mechanisms=[my_mech_1, my_mech_2],
                     name='my_LC')

Calling `my_LC.show()` generates the following report::

    my_LC
COMMENT:
        Monitoring the following Mechanism OutputStates:
            None
COMMENT

        Modulating the following Mechanism parameters:
            my_logistic_mechanism: gain
            my_linear_mechanism: slope

Note that the LCMechanism controls the `multiplicative_param <Function_Modulatory_Params>` of the `function
<Mechanism_Base.function>` of each Mechanism:  the `gain <Logistic.gain>` parameter for ``my_mech_1``, since it uses
a `Logistic` Function; and the `slope <Linear.slope>` parameter for ``my_mech_2``, since it uses a `Linear` Function.

.. _LCMechanism_Execution:

Execution
---------

An LCMechanism executes within a `Composition` at a point specified in the Composition's `Scheduler` or, if it is
the `controller <System_Base>` for a `Composition`, after all of the other Mechanisms in the Composition have `executed
<Composition_Execution>` in a `TRIAL`. It's `function <LCMechanism.function>` takes the `value <InputState.value>` of
the LCMechanism's `primary InputState <InputState_Primary>` as its input, and generates a response -- under the
influence of its `mode <LCMechanism.mode>` parameter -- that is assigned as the `value <ControlSignal.value>` of its
`ControlSignals <ControlSignal>`.  The latter are used by its `ControlProjections <ControlProjection>` to modulate the
response -- in the next `TRIAL` of execution --  of the Mechanisms the LCMechanism controls.

.. note::
   A `ParameterState` that receives a `ControlProjection` does not update its value until its owner Mechanism
   executes (see `Lazy Evaluation <LINK>` for an explanation of "lazy" updating).  This means that even if a
   LCMechanism has executed, the `multiplicative_param <Function_Modulatory_Params>` parameter of the `function
   <Mechanism_Base.function>` of a Mechanism that it controls will not assume its new value until that Mechanism has
   executed.

    Arguments
    ---------

    input_states :  List[`OutputState`, `Mechanism`] : default None
        specifies the OutputStates from which the LCMechanism should receive its `input <LCMechanism_Input>`;  if a
        Mechanism is specified, its `primary OutputState <OutputState_Primary>` is used. A `MappingProjection` is
        generated from each OutputState specified to a corresponding InputState created for the LCMechanism.

    mode : float or List[List[monitored_output_states specification]: default 0.0
        specifies the default value for the `mode <FHNIntegrator.mode>` parameter of the LCMechanism's `function
        <LCMechanism.function>`, or a list of OutputStates to be monitored, the values of which are used to regulate
        the value of the `mode <FHNIntegrator.mode>` parameter.  It can be specified using any of the forms used to
        `specify the <ObjectiveMechanism_Monitored_output_states>` **monitored_output_states** `argument
        <ObjectiveMechanism_Monitored_output_states>` of an ObjectiveMechanism.

    modulated_mechanisms : List[`Mechanism`] or *ALL*
        specifies the Mechanisms to be modulated by the LCMechanism. If it is a list, every item must be a Mechanism
        with a `function <Mechanism_Base.function>` that implements a `multiplicative_param
        <Function_Modulatory_Params>`;  alternatively the keyword *ALL* can be used to specify all of the
        `ProcessingMechanisms <ProcessingMechanism>` in the Composition(s) to which the LCMechanism
        belongs.

    params : Optional[Dict[param keyword, param value]]
        a `parameter dictionary <ParameterState_Specification>` that can be used to specify the parameters
        for the Mechanism, parameters for its function, and/or a custom function and its parameters. Values
        specified for parameters in the dictionary override any assigned to those parameters in arguments of the
        constructor.

    name : str : default LCMechanism-<index>
        a string used for the name of the Mechanism.
        If not is specified, a default is assigned by `MechanismRegistry`
        (see :doc:`Registry <LINK>` for conventions used in naming, including for default and duplicate names).

    prefs : Optional[PreferenceSet or specification dict : Mechanism.classPreferences]
        the `PreferenceSet` for the Mechanism.
        If it is not specified, a default is assigned using `classPreferences` defined in __init__.py
        (see :doc:`PreferenceSet <LINK>` for details).


    Attributes
    ----------

    input_states : ContentAddressableList[`InputState`]
        a list of the LCMechanism's `InputStates <Mechanism_InputStates>` that determine its `input
        <LCMechanism_Input>`;  each receives a `MappingProjection` from an `OutputState` specified in the
        **input_states** argument of the LCMechanism's constructor. The sum of their `value <InputState.value>`\\s is
        used as the `variable <FHNIntegrator.variable>` for the LCMechanism's `function <LCMechanism.function>`.

    mode : float : default 0.0
        determines the value for the `mode <FHNIntegrator.mode>` parameter of the LCMechanism's
        `FHNIntegrator` function (see `LCMechanism_Modes_Of_Operation` for additional details).

    controller : None or LCController
        lists the ControlMechanism used to regulate the value of the LCMechanism's `mode <LCMechanism.mode>` attribute.
        It receives its input from the LCMechanism's `objective_mechanism`, and sends a `ControlProjection` to its
        `primary InputState <InputState_Primary>`.

    objective_mechanism : None or `ObjectiveMechanism`
        lists the Mechanism used to monitor and evaluate any OutputStates specified in the **mode** argument of the
        LCMechanism's constructor, the `value <OutputState.value>`\\s of which are used by its `controller
        <LCMechanism.controller>` to regulate the value of its `mode <LCMechanism.mode>` attribute.  It is the same
        as the `controller <LCMechanism.controller>`'s `objective_mechanism <LCController.objective_mechanism>`
        attribute.

    monitored_output_states : None or List[`OutputState`]
        lists the `OutputStates <OutputState>` specified in the **mode** argument of the LCMechanism's constructor,
        and monitored by its `objective_mechanism <LCMechanism.objective_mechanism>`; their `value
        <OutputState.value>`\\s are used by the LCMechanism's `controller <LCMechanism.controller>` to regulate
        the value of its `mode <LCMechanism.mode>` attribute.  It is the same as the :keyword:`monitored_output_states`
        attributes of the `controller <LCMechanism.controller>` and `objective_mechanism
        <LCMechanism.objective_mechanism>`.

    function : `FitzHughNagumoIntegrator`
        takes the LCMechanism's `input <LCMechanism_Input>` and generates its response <LCMechanism_Output>` under
        the influence of its `mode <LCMechanism.mode>` attribute (see `LCMechanism_Function` for additional details).
