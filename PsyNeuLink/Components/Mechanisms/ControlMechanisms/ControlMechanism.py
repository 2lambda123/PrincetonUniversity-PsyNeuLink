"""
Overview
--------

ControlMechanisms monitor the `outputState(s) <OutputState>` of `ProcessingMechanisms <ProcessingMechanism>` in a
`System`, to assess the outcome of processing of those mechanisms.  They use this information to regulate the value of
parameters of those or other mechanisms (or their functions) in the system.  This is done by way of
`ControlProjections <ControlProjection>` from the ControlMechanism to the `ParameterStates <ParameterState>` for the
parameter(s) to be controlled.  A ControlMechanism can regulate only the parameters of mechanism in the system for
which it is the `controller <System_Execution_Control>`.

.. _ControlMechanism_Creation:

Creating A ControlMechanism
---------------------------

ControlMechanisms can be created by using the standard Python method of calling the constructor for the desired type.
A ControlMechanism is also created automatically whenever a `system is created <System_Creation>`, and assigned as
the `controller <System_Execution_Control>` for that system. The `outputStates <OutputState>` to be monitored by a
ControlMechanism are specified in its `monitoredOutputStates` argument, which can take  a number of
`forms <ControlMechanism_Monitored_OutputStates>`.  When the ControlMechanism is created, it automatically creates its
own `inputState <InputState>` for each of the outputStates it monitors, and assigns a  `MappingProjection` from each
of those outputStates to the inputState of the ControlMechanism. How a ControlMechanism creates its ControlProjections
depends on the `subclass <ControlMechanism>`.

.. _ControlMechanism_Specifying_Control:

Specifying control for a parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ControlMechanisms are used to control the parameter values of mechanisms and/or their functions.  A parameter can be
specified for control by assigning a `ControlProjection` as part of its value when creating the mechanism or function
to which the parameter belongs (see `Mechanism_Parameters`).

.. _ControlMechanism_Monitored_OutputStates:

Monitored OutputStates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The outputState(s) monitored by a ControlMechanism can be specified in any of the places listed below.  The
list also describes the order of precedence when more than one specification pertains to the same
outputState(s). In all cases, specifications can be a references to an outputState object, or a string that is the
name of one (see :ref:ControlMechanism_Examples' below). The specification of whether an outputState is monitored by
a ControlMechanism can be done in the following places:

* **OutputState**: an outputState can be *excluded* from being monitored by assigning `None` as the value of the
  :keyword:`MONITOR_FOR_CONTROL` entry of a parameter specification dictionary in the outputState's ``params``
  argument.  This specification takes precedence over any others;  that is, specifying `None` will suppress
  monitoring of that outputState, irrespective of any other specifications that might otherwise apply to that
  outputState;  thus, it can be used to exclude the outputState for cases in which it would otherwise be monitored
  based on one of the other specification methods below.
..
* **Mechanism**: the outputState of a particular mechanism can be designated to be monitored, by specifying it in the
  `MONITOR_FOR_CONTROL` entry of a parameter specification dictionary in the mechanism's `params` argument.  The value
  of the entry must be either a list containing the outputState(s) and/or their name(s),
  a `monitoredOutputState tuple <ControlMechanism_OutputState_Tuple>`, a `MonitoredOutputStatesOption` value, or `None`.
  The values of `MonitoredOutputStatesOption` are treated as follows:

    * `PRIMARY_OUTPUT_STATES`: only the primary (first) outputState of the mechanism is monitored;
    |
    * `ALL_OUTPUT_STATES`:  all of the mechanism's outputStates are monitored.

  This specification takes precedence over any of the other types listed below:  if it is `None`, then none of
  that mechanism's outputStates will be monitored;   if it specifies outputStates to be monitored, those will be
  monitored even if the mechanism is not a `TERMINAL` mechanism (see below).
..
* **ControlMechanism** or **System**: outputStates to be monitored can be specified in the ControlMechanism responsible
  for the monitoring, or in the system for which that ControlMechanism is the `controller`.  The specification can be
  in the `monitor_for_control` argument of the ControlMechanism or System's constructor, or in the `MONITOR_FOR_CONTROL`
  entry of a parameter specification dictionary in the `params` argument of the constructor.  In either case, the value
  must be a list, each item of which must be one of the following:

  * an existing **outputState** or the name of one.
  |
  * a **mechanism** or the name of one -- only the mechanism's primary (first) outputState will be monitored,
    unless a `MonitoredOutputStatesOption` value is also in the list (see below) or the specification is
    overridden in a params dictionary for the mechanism (see above);
  |
  * a `monitoredOutputState tuple <ControlMechanism_OutputState_Tuple>`;
  |
  * a value of `MonitoredOutputStatesOption` --  this applies to any mechanisms that appear in the list
    (except those that override it with their own `monitor_for_control` specification); if the value of
    `MonitoredOutputStatesOption` appears alone in the list, it is treated as follows:

    * `PRIMARY_OUTPUT_STATES` -- only the primary (first) outputState of the `TERMINAL` mechanism(s)
      in the system for which the ControlMechanism is the `controller` is monitored;
    |
    * `ALL_OUTPUT_STATES` -- all of the outputStates of the `TERMINAL` mechanism(s)
      in the system for which the ControlMechanism is the `controller` are monitored;
  * `None`.

  Specifications in a ControlMechanism take precedence over any in the system; both are superceded by specifications
  in the constructor or params dictionary for an outputState or mechanism.

.. _ControlMechanism_OutputState_Tuple:

**MonitoredOutputState Tuple**

A tuple can be used wherever an outputState can be specified, to determine how its value is combined with others by
the ControlMechanism to compute the outcome of processing for the system (e.g., the EVCMechanism's
`outcome_function <EVCMechanism.EVCMechanism.outcome_function>`). Each tuple must have the three following items in the
order listed:

  * an outputState or mechanism, the name of one, or a specification dictionary for one;
  ..
  * a weight (int) - multiplies the value of the outputState.
  ..
  * an exponent (int) - exponentiates the value of the outputState;

The set of weights and exponents assigned to each outputState is listed in the ControlMechanism's
`monitor_for_control_weights_and_exponents` attribute, in the same order as the outputStates are listed in its
`monitoredOutputStates` attribute.  Each item in the list is a tuple with the weight and exponent for a given
outputState.

.. _ControlMechanism_Execution:

Execution
---------

A ControlMechanism that is a system's `controller` is always the last mechanism to be executed (see `System Control
<System_Execution_Control>`).  Its `function <ControlMechanism.function>` takes as its input the values of the
outputStates in its `monitoredOutputStates` attribute, and uses those to determine the value of its
`ControlProjections <ControlProjection>`. In the subsequent round of execution, each ControlProjection's value is
used by the `ParameterState` to which it projects to update the parameter being controlled.

.. note::
   A `ParameterState` that receives a `ControlProjection` does not update its value until its owner mechanism
   executes (see `Lazy Evaluation <LINK>` for an explanation of "lazy" updating).  This means that even if a
   ControlMechanism has executed, a parameter that it controls will not assume its new value until the corresponding
   receiver mechanism has executed.

               When any other ControlMechanism is instantiated, if its params[MAKE_DEFAULT_CONTROLLER] == True
                   then its _take_over_as_default_controller method is called in _instantiate_attributes_after_function()

            MONITOR_FOR_CONTROL param determines which states will be monitored.
