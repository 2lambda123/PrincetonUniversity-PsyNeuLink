Overview
--------
A ModulatorySignal is a subclass of `OutputState` that belongs to an `AdaptiveMechanism`, and is used to `modulate
<ModulatorySignal_Modulation>` the `value <State.value>` of another `State` by way of one or more
`ModulatoryProjections <ModulatoryProjection>`.  There are three types of ModulatySignals, each of which is
associated with a particular type of `AdaptiveMechanism` and `ModulatoryProjection`, as described below:

* `LearningSignal`
    This takes the `value <LearningSignal.value>` assigned to it by the `LearningMechanism` to which it belongs,
    and uses it to modulate the parameter of a `PathwayProjection` -- usually the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>`
    parameter of a `MappingProjection`.
..
* `ControlSignal`
    This takes the `value <ControlSignal.value>` assigned to it by the `ControlMechanism` to which it belongs,
    and uses it to modulate the parameter of a `Mechanism` or its `function <Mechanism.function>`.
..
* `GatingSignal`
    This takes the `value <GatingSignal.value>` assigned to it by the `GatingMechanism` to which it belongs,
    and uses it to modulate the value of the `InputState` or `OutputState` of a `Mechanism`.

.. _ModulatorySignal_Creation:

Creating a ModulatorySignal
---------------------------

A ModulatorySignal is a base class, and cannot be instantiated directly.  However, the three types of ModulatorySignals
listed above can be created directly, by calling the constructor for the desired type.  More commonly, however,
ModulatorySignals are created automatically by the `AdaptiveMechanism` to which they belong, or by specifying them
in the constructor for the `AdaptiveMechanism` to which it belongs (the details of which are described in the
documentation for each type of ModulatorySignal).

.. _ModulatorySignal_Structure:

Structure
---------

Each ModulatorySignal has a `modulation <ModulatorySignal.modulation>` attribute that determines how the GatingProjection
is used by the state to which it projects to modify its value (see `modulation <ModulatoryProjection.modulation>`
for an explanation of how this attribute is specified and used to modulate the value of a state).  The default value
is set to the value of the `modulation <GatingMechanism.modulation>` attribute of the GatingMechanism to which the
ModulatorySignal belongs;  this the is same for all of the ModulatorySignal belonging to that GatingMechanism.  However, the
`modulation <ModulatorySignal.modulation>` can be specified individually for a ModulatorySignal using a specification
dictionary where the ModulatorySignal is specified, as described `above <ModulatorySignal_Specification>`. The
`modulation <ModulatorySignal.modulation>` value of a ModulatorySignal is used by all of the
`GatingProjections <GatingProjection>` that project from that ModulatorySignal.

***EXPLAIN HOW MODULATION WORKS
***EXPLAIN ABOUT mod_afferents

COMMENT: THIS BELONGS SOMEWHERE ELSE, AS ModulatoryProjections DON'T HAVE A modulation PARAMETER
  In addition, all ModulatoryProjections have a
`modulation <ModulatoryProjection.modulation>` attribute that determines how the projection
modifies the function of the state to which it projects.  The modulation is specified using a value of
`Modulation`, which designates one of the following standard actions to take
either a parameter of the state's function to modulate, or one of two other
actions to take, as follows:

    * `Modulation.MULTIPLY` - modulate the parameter designated by the <state's function <State.function>` as its
      `multiplicative_param <ModulationParam.MULTIPLICATIVE>`
      (for example, it is the `slope <Linear.slope>` parameter of the `Linear` Function);
ï£¿
    * `Modulation.ADD` - use the parameter designated by the <state's function <State.function>` as its
      `additive_param <ModulationParam.ADDITIVE>`
      (for example, it is the `slope <Linear.slope>` parameter of the `Linear` Function);

    * `Modulation.OVERRIDE` - use the ModulatoryProjection's value, bypassing the state's `function <State.function>`.

    * `Modulation.DISABLE` - use the parameter's value without any modulation.

In addition to the parameters specifed by a state's function as its :keyword:`multiplicative` :keyword:`additive`
parameters, some functions may also designate other parameters that can be used for modulation.  The modulation
value for a state can be assigned in a `State specification dictionary <LINK>` assigned in the **params** arg of a
state's constructor, or in the **modulation** arg of the constructor for an `AdaptiveMechanism`.  If a `modulation`
value is not specified for a state, its default modulation value is used.

Execution
---------



.. note::
   The change in the value of a `State` in response to a ModulatorySignal is not applied until the mechanism(s) to
   which the state belongs is next executed; see :ref:`Lazy Evaluation <LINK>` for an explanation of "lazy" updating).

    A subclass of OutputState that represents the value of a ModulatorySignal provided to a `GatingProjection`.

    COMMENT:

        Description
        -----------
            The ModulatorySignal class is a subtype of the OutputState class in the State category of Component,
            It is used primarily as the sender for GatingProjections
            Its FUNCTION updates its value:
                note:  currently, this is the identity function, that simply maps variable to self.value

        Class attributes:
            + componentType (str) = GATING_SIGNAL
            + paramClassDefaults (dict)
                + FUNCTION (LinearCombination)
                + FUNCTION_PARAMS (Modulation.MULTIPLY)
            + paramNames (dict)

        Class methods:
            function (executes function specified in params[FUNCTION];  default: Linear

        StateRegistry
        -------------
            All OutputStates are registered in StateRegistry, which maintains an entry for the subclass,
              a count for all instances of it, and a dictionary of those instances
    COMMENT


    Arguments
    ---------

    owner : GatingMechanism
        specifies the `GatingMechanism` to which to assign the ModulatorySignal.

    function : Function or method : default Linear
        specifies the function used to determine the value of the ModulatorySignal from the value of its
        `owner <GatingMechanism.owner>`.

    COMMENT: [NEEDS DOCUMENTATION]
    COMMENT
    modulation : ModulationParam : default ModulationParam.MULTIPLICATIVE 

    params : Optional[Dict[param keyword, param value]]
        a `parameter dictionary <ParameterState_Specifying_Parameters>` that can be used to specify the parameters for
        the ControlSignal and/or a custom function and its parameters. Values specified for parameters in the dictionary
        override any assigned to those parameters in arguments of the constructor.

    name : str : default OutputState-<index>
        a string used for the name of the outputState.
        If not is specified, a default is assigned by the StateRegistry of the mechanism to which the outputState
        belongs (see :doc:`Registry <LINK>` for conventions used in naming, including for default and duplicate names).

    prefs : Optional[PreferenceSet or specification dict : State.classPreferences]
        the `PreferenceSet` for the outputState.
        If it is not specified, a default is assigned using `classPreferences` defined in __init__.py
        (see :doc:`PreferenceSet <LINK>` for details).


    Attributes
    ----------

    owner : GatingMechanism
        the `GatingMechanism` to which the ModulatorySignal belongs.

    variable : number, list or np.ndarray
        used by `function <ModulatorySignal.function>` to compute the ModulatorySignal's `value <ModulatorySignal.value>`.

    function : TransferFunction :  default Linear(slope=1, intercept=0)
        provides the ModulatorySignal's `value <GatingMechanism.value>`; the default is an identity function that
        passes the input to the GatingMechanism as value for the ModulatorySignal.

    value : number, list or np.ndarray
        result of `function <ModulatorySignal.function>`.
    
    modulation : ModulationParam
        determines how the output of the ModulatorySignal is used to modulate the value of the state(s)
        to which its GatingProjection(s) project(s).

    efferents : [List[GatingProjection]]
        a list of the `GatingProjections <GatingProjection>` assigned to the ModulatorySignal.

    name : str : default <State subclass>-<index>
        name of the outputState.
        Specified in the **name** argument of the constructor for the outputState.  If not is specified, a default is
        assigned by the StateRegistry of the mechanism to which the outputState belongs
        (see :doc:`Registry <LINK>` for conventions used in naming, including for default and duplicate names).

        .. note::
            Unlike other PsyNeuLink components, state names are "scoped" within a mechanism, meaning that states with
            the same name are permitted in different mechanisms.  However, they are *not* permitted in the same
            mechanism: states within a mechanism with the same base name are appended an index in the order of their
            creation.

    prefs : PreferenceSet or specification dict : State.classPreferences
        the `PreferenceSet` for the outputState.
        Specified in the **prefs** argument of the constructor for the projection;  if it is not specified, a default is
        assigned using `classPreferences` defined in __init__.py
        (see :doc:`PreferenceSet <LINK>` for details).
