.. _ModulatoryProjection_Overview:

Overview
--------

ModulatoryProjections allow information to be passed between mechanisms.  A projection takes its input from the
`outputState <OutputState>` of one mechanism (its `sender <Projection.sender>`), and does whatever conversion is
needed to transmit that information to the `inputState <InputState>` of another mechanism (its
`receiver <Projection.receiver>`).  There are three types of projections that serve difference purposes:

* `LearningProjection`
    These take an `error_signal <LearningProjection.LearningProjection.error_signal>`,Â usually the output of a
    `MonitoringMechanism <MonitoringMechanism>`, and transmit this to the `parameterState <ParameterState>` of a
    `MappingProjection` which uses this to modify its `matrix <MappingProjection.MappingProjection.matrix>`
    parameter. LearningProjections are used when learning has been specified for a `process <Process_Learning>`
    or `system <System_Execution_Learning>`.
..
* `GatingProjection`
    These take an `allocation <ControlProjection.ControlProjection.allocation>` specification, usually the ouptput
    of a `ControlMechanism <ControlMechanism>`, and transmit this to the `parameterState <ParameterState>` of
    a ProcessingMechanism which uses this to modulate a parameter of the mechanism or its function.
    ControlProjections are typically used in the context of a `System`.
..
* `ControlProjection`
    These take an `allocation <ControlProjection.ControlProjection.allocation>` specification, usually the ouptput
    of a `ControlMechanism <ControlMechanism>`, and transmit this to the `parameterState <ParameterState>` of
    a ProcessingMechanism which uses this to modulate a parameter of the mechanism or its function.
    ControlProjections are typically used in the context of a `System`.

COMMENT:
* Gating: takes an input signal and uses it to modulate the inputState and/or outputState of the receiver

.. _Projection_Creation:

Creating a ModulatoryProjection
-------------------------------

A ModulatoryProjection can be created on its own, by calling the constructor for the desired type of projection.  More
commonly, however, projections are either specified `in context <Projection_In_Context_Specification>`, or
are `created automatically <Projection_Automatic_Creation>`, as described below.
