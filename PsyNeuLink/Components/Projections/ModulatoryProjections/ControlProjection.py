.. _ControlProjection_Overview:

Overview
--------

A ControlProjection is a subclass of `Projection` that projects to the `parameterState <ParameterState>`
of a `ProcessingMechanism`. It takes the value of an `outputState <OutputState> of another mechanism (e.g., usually a
`ControlMechanism <ControlMechanism>`), and uses it to  modify the value of the parameter associated with the
parameterState to which it projects.  All of the ControlProjections in a system, along with its other 
`control components <ControlMechanism>`, can be displayed using the system's `show_graph` method with its 
**show_control** argument assigned :keyword:`True`.

.. _ControlProjection_Creation:

Creating a ControlProjection
----------------------------

A ControlProjection can be created using any of the standard ways to `create a projection <Projection_Creation>`,
or by including it in the `specification of a parameter <ParameterState_Specifying_Parameters>` for a mechanism,
MappingProjection, or the :keyword:`function` of either of these.  If a ControlProjection is created using its
constructor on its own, the `receiver <ControlProjection.receiver>` argument must be specified.  If it is included in a
parameter specification, the parameterState for the parameter being specified will be assigned as the
ControlProjection's `receiver <ControlProjection.receiver>`.  If its `sender <ControlProjection.sender>` is not
specified, its assignment depends on the `receiver <ControlProjection.receiver>`.  If the receiver belongs to a
mechanism that is part of a system, then the ControlProjection's `sender <ControlProjection.sender>` is assigned to an
outputState of the system's `controller`. Otherwise, the `sender <ControlProjection.sender>` is assigned to
the outputState of a `DefaultControlMechanism`.

.. _ControlProjection_Structure:

Structure
---------

A ControlProjection has the same structure as a `Projection`.  Its `sender <ControlProjection.sender>`
can be the outputState of any mechanism, but is generally a `ControlMechanism <ControlMechanism>` and commonly the
`ControlSignal` of an `EVCMechanism`.  Its `receiver <ControlProjection.receiver>` is always the `parameterState
<ParameterState>` of a mechanism or `MappingProjection`, that is associated with a parameter of either the
parameterState's owner or it owner's :keyword:`function`.  The `function <ControlProjection.function>` of a
ControlProjection is, by default, the identity function;  that is, it uses the :keyword:`value` of its `sender
<ControlProjection.sender>` to modify the value of the parameter that it controls.

.. _ControlProjection_Execution:

Execution
---------

A ControlProjection uses its `function <ControlProjection.function>` to assign its `value <ControlProjection.value>`
from the one received  from its `sender <ControlProjection.sender>`.  This is used by the paramaterState to which the
ControlProjection projects to modify the corresponding parameter of its owner or owner's :keyword:`function`.

.. note::
   The changes in a parameter in response to the execution of a ControlProjection are not applied until the
   mechanism that receives the projection are next executed; see :ref:`Lazy Evaluation` for an explanation of "lazy"
   updating).

    COMMENT:
        Description:
            The ControlProjection class is a type in the Projection category of Component.
            It implements a projection to the parameterState of a mechanism that modifies a parameter of its function.
            It:
               - takes a scalar as its input (sometimes referred to as an "allocation")
               - uses its `function` to compute its value (sometimes referred to as its "intensity"
                 based on its input (allocation) its `sender`,
               - used to modify a parameter of the owner of the `receiver` or its `function`.

        ** MOVE:
        ProjectionRegistry:
            All ControlProjections are registered in ProjectionRegistry, which maintains an entry for the subclass,
              a count for all instances of it, and a dictionary of those instances

    Arguments
    ---------

    sender : Optional[Mechanism or OutputState]
        specifies the source of the input for the ControlProjection;  usually an `outputState <OutputState>` of a
        `ControlMechanism <ControlMechanism>`, and commonly the `ControlSignal` of an `EVCMechanism`.  If it is not
        specified, the ControlProjection will 
        COMMENT:
        remain in DEFER_INITIALIZATION status, and will 
        COMMENT
        be ignored during execution.

    receiver : Optional[Mechanism or ParameterState]
        specifies the parameterState associated with the parameter to be controlled.  This must be specified,
        or be able to be determined by the context in which the ControlProjection is created or assigned.

    function : TransferFunction : default Linear
        specifies the function used to convert the :keyword:`value` of the ControlProjection's
        `sender <ControlProjection.sender>`  to its own `value <ControlProjection.value>`.

    params : Optional[Dict[param keyword, param value]]
        a `parameter dictionary <ParameterState_Specifying_Parameters>` that can be used to specify the parameters for
        the projection, its `function <ControlProjection.function>`, and/or a custom function and its parameters.
        Values specified for parameters in the dictionary override any assigned to those parameters in arguments of the
        constructor.

    name : str : default ControlProjection-<index>
        a string used for the name of the ControlProjection.
        If not is specified, a default is assigned by ProjectionRegistry
        (see :doc:`Registry <LINK>` for conventions used in naming, including for default and duplicate names).

    prefs : Optional[PreferenceSet or specification dict : Projection.classPreferences]
        the `PreferenceSet` for the ControlProjection.
        If it is not specified, a default is assigned using `classPreferences` defined in __init__.py
        (see :doc:`PreferenceSet <LINK>` for details).

    Attributes
    ----------

    componentType : CONTROL_PROJECTION

    sender : OutputState of ControlMechanism
        mechanism that provides the current input for the ControlProjection (usually a
        `ControlMechanism <ControlMechanism>`).

    receiver : ParameterState of Mechanism
        :doc:`parameterState <ParameterState>` for the parameter to be modified by the ControlProjection.

    allocation : 1d np.array
        the input to the ControlProjection; same as the :keyword:`value` of the `sender <ControlProjection.sender>`.

    value : float
        during initialization, assigned a keyword string (either `INITIALIZING` or `DEFERRED_INITIALIZATION`);
        during execution, is assigned the current value of the ControlProjection.

    name : str : default ControlProjection-<index>
        the name of the ControlProjection.
        Specified in the **name** argument of the constructor for the projection;
        if not is specified, a default is assigned by ProjectionRegistry
        (see :doc:`Registry <LINK>` for conventions used in naming, including for default and duplicate names).

    prefs : PreferenceSet or specification dict : Projection.classPreferences
        the `PreferenceSet` for projection.
        Specified in the **prefs** argument of the constructor for the projection;
        if it is not specified, a default is assigned using `classPreferences` defined in __init__.py
        (see :doc:`PreferenceSet <LINK>` for details).
