.. _LearningProjection_Overview:

Overview
--------

A LearningProjection takes as its input the output of its `sender <LearningProjection.sender>` --
a `MonitoringMechanism <MonitoringMechanism>`.  It uses this as an `error_signal` to compute a `weightChangeMatrix`
that is assigned as the `value <LearningProjection.value>` of the LearningProjection.  This is used, in turn,
by the LearningProjection's `receiver <LearningProjection.receiver>` -- a `parameterState <ParameterState>` for
a `MappingProjection` to modify its  `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter.  A LearningProjection can
be assigned different `functions <LearningProjection_Function>` to implement different learning algorithms,
which are associated with corresponding types of `MonitoringMechanisms <MonitoringMechanism>`.

.. _LearningProjection_Creation:

Creating a LearningProjection
------------------------------------

A LearningProjection can be created in any of the ways that can be used to `create a projection <Projection_Creation>`,
or by including it in the specification of a `system <System>`, `process <Process>`, or projection in the `pathway`
of a process.  Its `sender <LearningProjection.sender>` (the source of its `error_signal`) must be a
`MonitoringMechanism`, and its `receiver <LearningProjection.receiver>` must be the `parameterState <ParameterState>`
of a `MappingProjection`.  When a LearningProjection is created, its full initialization is
:ref:`deferred <Component_Deferred_Init>` until its `sender <LearningProjection.sender>` and
`receiver <LearningProjection.receiver>` have been fully specified.  This allows a LearningProjection to be created
before its `sender` and/or `receiver` have been created (e.g., before them in a script), by calling its constructor
without specifying its :keyword:`sender` or :keyword:`receiver` arguments.

It is also possible to create a LearningProjection without ever specifying its :keyword:`sender`.  In this case,
when it is initialized, the type of `MonitoringMechanism <MonitoringMechanism>` it requires will be inferred from
context, and created when it is initialized (see `Structure <LearningProjection_Structure>` below).  In contrast, a
LearningProjection's :keyword:`receiver` must be explicitly specified at some point.  Once that is done,
for the LearningProjection to be operational, initializaton must be completed by calling its `deferred_init`
method.  This is not necessary if learning has been specified for a `system <System_Execution_Learning>`,
`process <Process_Learning>`, or as the `projection <MappingProjection_Tuple_Specification>` in the `pathway` of a
process -- in those cases, deferred initialization is completed automatically.

COMMENT:
   REPLACE WITH THIS ONCE FUNCTIONALITY IS IMPLEMENTED
    Initialization will
    be  completed as soon as the LearningProjection has been assigned as the projection *from* a MonitoringMechanism (i.e.,
    it's ``sender`` has been specified) and as the projection *to* the parameterState of a MappingProjection (i.e.,
    its ``receiver`` has been specified).  This is handled automatically when the LearningProjection is specified as part of
    a system, process, or projection in the pathway of a process.
COMMENT

.. _LearningProjection_Automatic_Creation:

Automatic creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When learning is specified for a `process <Process_Learning>` or `system <System_Execution_Learning>`, or in a
`tuple that specifies a LearningProjection <MappingProjection_Tuple_Specification>`, PsyNeuLink automatically
generates a LearningProjection and the associated components required for learning to occur (shown in the
:ref:`figure <LearningProjection_Simple_Learning_Figure>` and described under
:ref:`Structure <LearningProjection_Structure>` below).  These are generated for each MappingProjection that will
be modified by learning;  for a process, this includes the MappingProjections between each of the mechanisms in the
process.

COMMENT:
    When learning is :ref:`specified for a process <Process_Learning>`, or in a
    :ref:`tuple that specifies a projection <LINK>`,  PsyNeuLink automatically generates the LearningProjection,
    MonitoringMechanisms, and corresponding projections required for learning to occur (shown in the
    :ref:`figure below <LearningProjection_Simple_Learning_Figure>`). More specifically, a LearningProjection
    is automatically created and  assigned to each MappingProjection for which it is specified (i.e., that it will
    modify). For a process, LearningProjections are created for the MappingProjection between each of the mechanisms
    in the process.

The `receiver <MappingProjection.MappingProjection.receiver>` for each of those MappingProjections is assigned as the
`errorSource <LearningProjection.errorSource>` for the LearningProjection.  Each errorSource must project to a
:doc:`MonitoringMechanism`, which is assigned as the the LearningSignal's sender, and provides it with an
`error_signal`. If the `errorSource` assigned to a LearningProjection already has a projection to a
MonitoringMechanism, then that mechanism is simply assigned as the LearningProjection's
`sender <LearningProjection.sender>`; if the `errorSource` does not project to any MonitoringMechanism, then one is
created for it at the same time that the LearningProjection is created.

The type of MonitoringMechanism created depends on the type of learning. For `Reinforcement Learning <Reinforcement>`,
a `ComparatorMechanism` is created, and given a MappingProjection from the `errorSource`. For
`BackPropagation`, the type of  MonitoringMechanism created also depends on the `errorSource` itself.  If
the `errorSource` provides the output that will be compared with the target stimulus then, as for Reinforcement
Learning, a ComparatorMechanism is created.  This is the case if the `errorSource` is a standalone
mechanism (one not in a process or system), the `TERMINAL` mechanism of a standalone process (i.e., one not
in a system), or the `TERMINAL` mechanism of a system.  However, if the `errorSource` lies deeper in a process
or system -- that is, if it is an `ORIGIN` or `INTERNAL` mechanism -- then a `WeightedErrorMechanism` mechanism
is created.  This gets its error information from the MonitoringMechanism for the `errorSource` "after" it in the
process or system (i.e., the one to which it projects, and that is one closer to
the target).  Therefore, a MappingProjection is created that projects to it from that next `errorSource`.

    **Components of Learning**

    .. figure:: _static/LearningProjection_Simple_Learning_fig.jpg
       :alt: Schematic of mechanisms and projections involved in learning
       :scale: 50%

       Learning mechanisms (darker background) and associated projections created for a set of mechanisms specified for
       learning (lighter backgrounds).  Each mechanism is labeled by its type (uppler line, in bold) and its designated
       status in the process and/or system to which it belongs (lower line, caps).  Italicized labels beside each
       mechanism indicate the attributes of the LearningProjection with which they are associated.

.. _LearningProjection_Structure:

Structure
---------

The following components are required for learning
(see :ref:`figure above <LearningProjection_Simple_Learning_Figure>`):

**MappingProjection**: owner of the `parameterState <ParameterState>` to which the LearningProjection projects,
and of the `matrix <MappingProjection.MappingProjection.matrix>` to be modified by learning. It is referenced by the
LearningProjection's `mappingProjection` attribute.

**Error source**: ProcessingMechanism to which the `mappingProjection` that is being learned projects;  it is the
mechanism responsible for the component of the error that the LearningProjection tries to correct.  It is
referenced by the LearningProjection's `errorSource <LearningProjection.errorSource>` attribute.  The
`errorSource <LearningProjection.errorSource>` must project to a `MonitoringMechanism` (see below). By default,
the `primary outputState <OutputState_Primary>` of the `errorSource <LearningProjection.errorSource>` projects to the
MonitoringMechanism. However, a different outputState can be specified by including an
entry with `MONITOR_FOR_LEARNING` as its key in a `parameter dictionary <ParameterState_Specifying_Parameters>` for
the `errorSource <LearningProjection.errorSource>`, and assigning it a list with the desired outputState(s) as its
value. When a LearningProjection is `created automatically <LearningProjection_Automatic_Creation>`,
if its `errorSource <LearningProjection.errorSource>` already has a projection to a MonitoringMechanism,
then that one is used; if its `errorSource <LearningProjection.errorSource>` does not project to any
MonitoringMechanism, then one of an appropriate type is created (see below) and assigned a MappingProjection from the
`errorSource <LearningProjection.errorSource>`.

.. _LearningProjection_MonitoringMechanism:

**MonitoringMechanism**: its outputState serves as the `sender <LearningProjection.sender>` for the LearningProjection.
It calculates the `error_signal` used by the LearningProjection to reduce the contribution of its
`errorSource <LearningProjection.errorSource>` to the error.  The type of `MonitoringMechanism` required, and how it
calculates the `error_signal`, depend on the `function <LearningProjection.function>` that the LearningProjection uses
for learning. For `Reinforcement`, a `ComparatorMechanism` is used. This receives a MappingProjection directly from
the `errorSource <LearningProjection.errorSource>`, and receives a **target** stimulus from the process or system to
which the `errorSource <LearningProjection.errorSource>` belongs.  It calculates the `error_signal` by comparing the
output of the `errorSource <LearningProjection.errorSource>` with the target stimulus provided when the process or
system is `run <Run_Targets>`. For `BackPropagation`, the type of MonitoringMechanism depends on the
`errorSource <LearningProjection.errorSource>`. If the `errorSource <LearningProjection.errorSource>` receives a target
directly, then a `ComparatorMechanism` is used.  This is the case if the `errorSource <LearningProjection.errorSource>`
is a standalone mechanism (one not in a process or system), the `TERMINAL` mechanism of a standalone
process (i.e., one not in a system), the `TERMINAL` mechanism of a system, or it has been specified explicitly as a
`TARGET <LINK>` mechanism.  However, if the `errorSource <LearningProjection.errorSource>` lies deeper in any process
to which it  belongs (i.e., it is not a `TERMINAL` mechanism), and has not been explicitly specified as a
`TARGET <LINK>` and therefore does not receive a target directly, then a `WeightedErrorMechanism` mechanism is used.
This receives a MappingProjection carrying its error information from the MonitoringMechanism for the
`errorSource <LearningProjection.errorSource>` "after" it in the process (i.e., the one to which it projects, and that
is one closer to the target), rather than from a target stimulus. It calculates its `error_signal` by taking account of
the contribution that its `errorSource <LearningProjection.errorSource>` makes to the `error_signal` of the *next*
mechanism in the process or system.

**LearningProjection**:  this calculates the changes to the `matrix <MappingProjection.MappingProjection.matrix>`
parameter of the MappingProjection to which the LearningProjection projects (i.e., the owner of its
`receiver <LearningProjection.receiver>`), so as to reduce the error generated by its
`errorSource <LearningProjection.errorSource>`. It uses the `error_signal` received from the `MonitoringMechanism` (i.e.,
the owner of its `sender <LearningProjection.sender>`), to which the `errorSource <LearningProjection.errorSource>`
projects. The weight changes it provides to its `receiver <LearningProjection.receiver>`are stored in its
`weightChangeMatrix` attribute.

.. _LearningProjection_Targets:

**TARGET mechanisms**: receive the targets specified for learning.  When learning is specified for a `process
<Process_Learning>` or `system <System_Execution_Learning>`, the `MonitoringMechanism(s) <MonitoringMechanism>`  that
will receive its `targets <Run_Targets>` (specified in the call to its :keyword:`execute` or :keyword:`run` method)
are identified and designated as `TARGET` mechanisms. These are listed in the process` or system's
:keyword:`targetMechanisms` attribute. All other MonitoringMechanism(s) are designated as `MONITORING`. `TARGET`
mechanisms must be `ComparatorMechanisms <ComparatorMechanism>`; if the `BackPropagation` function is used for
learning, they must also be associated with (i.e., receive a projection from) a `TERMINAL` mechanism.  It is
important to note that, for this purpose, the status of a mechanism in a system takes precedence over its status in
any of the processes to which it belongs. This means that, although all of the `TERMINAL` mechanisms of a system are
associated with `TARGET` mechanisms, this *not* necessarily true for the `TERMINAL` mechanism of a process.  This is
because a mechanism may be the `TERMINAL` mechanism of a process, but not of the system to which it belongs
(see :ref:`figure below <_LearningProjection_Target_vs_Terminal_Figure>` for an example).  In such cases, the mechanism
is assigned a WeightedErrorMechanism rather than a ComparatorMechanism for learning, and is designated as a
`MONITORING` mechanism and *not* a `TARGET` mechanism.

.. _LearningProjection_Target_vs_Terminal_Figure:

    **TERMINAL** and **TARGET** Mechanisms in Learning

    .. figure:: _static/LearningProjection_TERMINAL_vs_TARGET_fig.jpg
       :alt: Schematic of mechanisms and projections involved in learning
       :scale: 50 %

       Mechanism 3 is the `TERMINAL` mechanism for Process A, However, it is also an `INTERNAL` mechanism of Process B.
       Therefore, Mechanism 3 is designated as an `INTERNAL` mechanism for the system, and Mechanism 4 is its `TERMINAL`
       mechanism. As a consequence, if `BackPropagation` is used for learning, then Mechanism 4 is assigned a
       `ComparatorMechanism` and designated as a `TARGET`, while Mechanism 3 is assigned a `WeightedErrorMechanism` and
       designated as a `MONITORING` mechanism.  This also means that, as long as Process A is specified as part of that
       system, it cannot be executed on its own with learning enabled (since it will have no `TARGET`)

.. _LearningProjection_Function:

**Function**:  calculates the changes to the `matrix <MappingProjection.MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter
of the LearningProjection's `mappingProjection required to reduce the error for its
`errorSource <LearningProjection.errorSource>`.  The result is assigned to the LearningProjection's
`weightChangeMatrix` attribute. The default `function <LearningProjection.function>` is BackPropagation` (also known
as the *Generalized Delta Rule*; see
`Rumelhart et al., 1986 <http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v323/n6088/abs/323533a0.html>`_). However, it can be
assigned to other functions that implement different learning algorithms, as long as it is compatible with the
:keyword:`function` of the LearningProjection's `errorSource <LearningProjection.errorSource>` (how the `error_signal`
is computed depends on the nature of the function that generated the error); failure to match the `function
<LearningProjection.function>` for the LearningProjection with  the :keyword:`function` of its
`errorSource <LearningProjection.errorSource>`  will generate an error.

.. _LearningProjection_Execution:

Execution
---------

LearningProjections are executed after all of the mechanisms in a process or system have executed, including the
MonitoringMechanisms that provide the `error_signal` to each LearningProjection.  When the LearningProjection is
executed, it uses its `error_signal` to calculate changes to the `matrix <MappingProjection.MappingProjection.matrix>`
of its `mappingProjection`. Changes to the matrix are calculated so as to reduce the `error_signal`. The changes are
assigned as the `value <LearningProjection.value>` of the LearningProjection, but are not applied to
the `matrix <MappingProjection.MappingProjection.matrix>` until the next time the `mappingProjection` is executed
(see :ref:`Lazy Evaluation <LINK>` for an explanation of "lazy" updating).
