.. _ControlProjection_Overview:

Overview
--------

A ControlProjection is a :doc:`projection <Projection> that projects to the :doc:`parameterState <ParameterState>`
of a mechanism.  It takes the value of an outputState of another mechanism (e.g., usually a :doc:`ControlMechanism`),
and uses it to modify the value of the parameter associated with the parameterState to which it projects.

.. _ControlProjection_Creation:

Creating a ControlProjection
----------------------------

A ControlProjection can be created using any of the standard ways to :ref:`create a projection <Projection_Creation>`,
or by including it in the :ref:`specification of a parameter <ParameterState_Specifying_Parameters>` for a mechanism,
MappingProjection, or the ``function`` of either of these.  If a ControlProjection is created using its constructor on
its own, the ``receiver`` argument must be specified.  If it is included in a parameter specification,
the parameterState for the parameter being specified will be assigned as the ControlProjection's ``receiver``.  If
its ``sender`` is not specified, its assignment depends on the ``receiver``.  If the receiver belongs to a mechanism
that is part of a system, then the ControlProjection's ``sender`` is assigned to an outputState of the system's
:ref:`controller  <System_Execution_Control>`. Otherwise, the ``sender`` is assigned to the outputState of a
:any:`DefaultControlMechanism`.

.. _ControlProjection_Structure:

Structure
---------

A ControlProjection has the same structure as a :doc:`Projection`.  Its
:py:data:`sender <Projection.Projection_Base.sender>` can be the outputState of any mechanism, but is generally a
:doc:`ControlMechansm`, and commonly the :doc:`ControlSignal` of an :doc:`EVCMechanism.`.  Its
:py:data:`receiver <Projection.Projection_Base.receiver>` is always the :doc:`paramterState <ParameterState>` of a
mechanism or :doc:`MappingProjection`, that is associated with a parameter of either the parameterState's owner or
it owner's ``function``.  The ``function`` of a ControlProjection is, by default, the identity function;  that is,
it uses the value of its sender to modify the value of the parameter that it controls.


.. _ControlProjection_Execution:

Execution
---------

A ControlProjection uses its ``function`` to assign its value from the one received from its :py:data:`sender`*[]:
This is used by the parmaterState to which it projects to modify the corresponding parameter of the
parameterState's owner or its owner's ``function``.

.. note::
   The changes in a parameter in response to the execution of a ControlProjection are not applied until the
   mechanism that receives the projection are next executed; see Lazy_Evaluation for an explanation of "lazy"
   updating).

     Implements a projection that controls the parameter of a mechanism's function.

    COMMENT:
        Description:
            The ControlProjection class is a type in the Projection category of Component.
            It implements a projection to the parameterState of a mechanism that modifies a parameter of its function.
            It:
               - takes an allocation (scalar) as its input (self.variable)
               - uses self.function (params[FUNCTION]) to compute intensity based on allocation from self.sender,
                   used by self.receiver.owner to modify a parameter of self.receiver.owner.function.

        ** MOVE:
        ProjectionRegistry:
            All ControlProjections are registered in ProjectionRegistry, which maintains an entry for the subclass,
              a count for all instances of it, and a dictionary of those instances

    Arguments
    ---------

    sender : Optional[Mechanism or OutputState]
        the source of the allocation for the ControlProjection;  usually an outputState of a :doc:`ControlMechanism`.
        If it is not specified, the :doc:`DefaultControlMechanism` for the system to which the receiver belongs
        will be assigned.

    receiver : Optional[Mechanism or ParameterState]
        the parameterState associated with the parameter of a function to be controlled.  This must be specified,
        or be able to be determined by the context in which the ControlProjection is created or assigned.

    function : TransferFunction : default Linear
        converts the value of the ControlProjection's :pyd:data:`sender`  into its ``value``.

    params : Optional[Dict[param keyword, param value]]
        a dictionary that can be used to specify the parameters for the projection, parameters for its function,
        and/or a custom function and its parameters (see :doc:`Component` for specification of a params dict).
        By default, it contains an entry for the projection's default ``function`` and cost function assignments.

    name : str : default ControlProjection-<index>
        a string used for the name of the ControlProjection.
        If not is specified, a default is assigned by ProjectionRegistry
        (see :doc:`Registry <LINK>` for conventions used in naming, including for default and duplicate names).

    prefs : Optional[PreferenceSet or specification dict : Projection.classPreferences]
        the PreferenceSet for the ControlProjection.
        If it is not specified, a default is assigned using ``classPreferences`` defined in __init__.py
        (see :py:class:`PreferenceSet <LINK>` for details).

    Attributes
    ----------

    sender : OutputState of ControlProjection
        mechanism that provides the current input for the ControlProjection (usuall a :doc:`ControlMechanisms`).

    receiver : ParameterState of Mechanism
        :doc:`parameterState <ParameterState>` for the parameter to be modified by ControlProjection.

    value : float
        during initialization, assigned keyword string (either INITIALIZING or DEFERRED_INITIALIZATION);
        during execution, returns the ``value`` of the ControlProjection.

    name : str : default ControlProjection-<index>
        the name of the ControlProjection.
        Specified in the name argument of the call to create the projection;
        if not is specified, a default is assigned by ProjectionRegistry
        (see :doc:`Registry <LINK>` for conventions used in naming, including for default and duplicate names).

    prefs : PreferenceSet or specification dict : Projection.classPreferences
        the PreferenceSet for projection.
        Specified in the prefs argument of the call to create the projection;
        if it is not specified, a default is assigned using ``classPreferences`` defined in __init__.py
        (see :py:class:`PreferenceSet <LINK>` for details).
