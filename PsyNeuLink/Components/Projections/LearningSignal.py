.. _LearningSignal_Overview:

Overview
--------

A LearningSignal projection takes a value (an *error signal*) from a :doc:`MonitoringMechanism` (its ``sender``),
and uses this to compute a ``weightChangeMatrix`` that is assigned as its value.  This is used to modify the
:ref:`matrix <Mapping_Matrix>` parameter of a :doc:`Mapping` projection.  A LearningSignal can be assigned different
functions[LINK] to implement different learning algorithms, which are associated with corresponding types of
MonitoringMechanisms.

.. _LearningSignal_Creating_A_LearningSignal_Projection:

Creating a LearningSignal Projection
------------------------------------

???INCLUDE: automatically by specifying the LEARNING_SIGNAL parameter of a Mapping Projection


A LearningSignal projection can be created in any of the ways that can be used to
:ref:`create a projection <Projection_Creating_A_Projection>`, or by including it in the specification of a
:ref:`system <System>`, :ref:`process <Process>`, or projection in the :ref:`pathway <>` of a process.  Its
``sender`` (the source of its error signal) must be a MonitoringMechanism, and its ``receiver`` must be the
parameterState of a Mapping projection.  When a LearningSignal is created, its full initialization is deferred [LINK]
until its ``sender`` and ``receiver`` have been fully specified.  This means that it is possible to create a
LearningSignal using its constructor without specifying either its ``sender`` or its ``receiver``.

COMMENT:
   CURRENT
COMMENT
It is not necessary to assign a ``sender``;  if none is specified when it is initialized, a MonitoringMechanism of
the appropriate type will be created (see :ref:`Structure <LearningSignal_Structure>` below).  However,
a LearningSignal's ``receiver`` must be specified.  One that is done, for the LearningSignal to be operational,
initializaton must be completed by calling its ``deferred_init`` method.  This is not necessary if the LearningSignal
is specified as part of a system, process, or a projection in the pathway of a process -- in those cases,
initialization is completed automatically.

THIS IS A TEST

COMMENT:
   REPLACE WITH THIS ONCE FUNCTIONALITY IS IMPLEMENTED
    Initialization will
    be  completed as soon as the LearningSignal has been assigned as the projection *from* a MonitoringMechanism (i.e.,
    it's ``sender`` has been specified) and as the projection *to* the parameterState of a Mapping projection (i.e.,
    its ``receiver`` has been specified).  This is handled automatically when the LearningSignal is specified as part of
    a system, process, or projection in the pathway of a process.
COMMENT

.. _LearningSignal_Structure:ï£¿

Structure
---------

POINT TO FIGURE IN PROCESS

*Error Signal*.  The ``variable`` for a LearningSignal is used as its ``errorSignal``.  It uses this to compute the
changes to the ``matrix`` parameter of the Mapping projection for which it is responsible (i.e., to which it
projects).  The error signal comes from the LearningSignal's ``sender``, which is a MonitoringMechanism that
evaluates the output of the ProcessingMechanism that receives the Mapping projection being trained (see :ref:`figure
<Process_Learning_Figure>`).


and is used
an error signal
, when it is executed, must have three components

# DOCUMENT: self.variable has 3 items:
#   input: <Mapping projection>.sender.value
#              (output of the Mechanism that is the sender of the Mapping projection)
#   output: <Mapping projection>.receiver.owner.outputState.value == self.errorSource.outputState.value
#              (output of the Mechanism that is the receiver of the Mapping projection)
#   error_signal: <Mapping projection>.receiver.owner.parameterState[MATRIX].receivesFromProjections[0].sender.value ==
#                 self.errorSource.monitoringMechanism.value
#                 (output of the MonitoringMechanism that is the sender of the LearningSignal
#                  for the next Mapping projection in the Process)

*Function*.

# The default for FUNCTION is BackPropagation;  also Reinforcement -- each requires a specific types of
ProcessingMechanisms and configuration of its MOnitoringMechanisms

*Monitoring Mechanism*.  -> error source

Primary (Comparator) vs. seconadry (WeightedError)

# DOCUMENT: if it instantiates a DefaultTrainingSignal:
#               if outputState for error source is specified in its paramsCurrent[MONITOR_FOR_LEARNING], use that
#               otherwise, use error_source.outputState (i.e., error source's primary outputState)



.. _LearningSignal_Execution:

Execution
---------

A LearningSignal projection uses its ``function`` to compute its ``intensity``, and its :ref:`cost functions
<LearningSignal_Cost_Functions> use the ``intensity`` to compute the its ``cost``.  The ``intensity`` is assigned as
the LearningSignal projection's ``value``, which is used by the parmaterState to which it projects to modify the
corresponding parameter of the owner mechanism's function.

.. note::
   The changes in a parameter in response to the execution of a LearningSignal projection are not applied until the
   mechanism that receives the projection are next executed; see Lazy_Evaluation for an explanation of "lazy"
   updating).
