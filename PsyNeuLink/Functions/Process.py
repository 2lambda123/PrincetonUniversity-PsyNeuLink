    Description:
        A Process is defined by a CONFIGURATION param (list of Mechanisms) and a time scale.  Executing a Process
         executes the Mechanisms in the order that they appear in the configuration.

    Instantiation:
        A Process can be instantiated in one of two ways:
            - by a direct call to Process()
            [TBI: - in a list to a call to System()]
        A Process instantiates its configuration by assigning:
            - a projection from the Process to the inputState of the first mechanism in the configuration
            - a projection from each mechanism in the list to the next (if one is not already specified)
                if the length of the preceding mechanism's outputState == the length of the follower's inputState
                    the identity matrix is used
                if the lengths are not equal, the unit full connectivity matrix is used
                if kwLearning has been specified:
                    the unit full connectivity matrix is used
                    kwLearning is specified for all Projections that have not otherwise been specified
            - any params specified as part of a (mechanism, params) tuple in the configuration
            - Process.outputState to Mechanism.outputState of the last mechanism in the configuration

    Initialization arguments:
        - input (value): used as input to first Mechanism in Configuration (default: first mech variableInstanceDefault)
            ProcessInputState is instantiated to represent each item in the input, and generate a mapping projection
                for it to the first Mechanism in the Configuration:
                if len(Process.input) == len(Mechanism.variable):
                    - create one projection for each of the Mechanism.inputState(s)
                if len(Process.input) == 1 but len(Mechanism.variable) > 1:
                    - create a projection for each of the Mechanism.inputStates, and provide Process.input.value to each
                if len(Process.input) > 1 but len(Mechanism.variable) == 1:
                    - create one projection for each Process.input value and assign all to Mechanism.inputState
                otherwise,  if len(Process.input) != len(Mechanism.variable) and both > 1:
                    - raise exception:  ambiguous mapping from Process input values to first Mechanism's inputStates
        - params (dict):
# DOCUMENT:  UPDATE TO INCLUDE Mechanism, Projection, Mechanism FORMAT, AND (Mechanism, Cycle) TUPLE
            CONFIGURATION (list): (default: single Mechanism_Base.defaultMechanism)
                Each config_entry must be one of the following, that is used to instantiate the mechanisms in the list:
                    + Mechanism object
                    + Mechanism type (class) (e.g., DDM)
                    + descriptor keyword for a Mechanism type (e.g., kwDDM)
                    + specification dict for Mechanism; the dict can have the following entries (see Mechanism):
                        + kwMechanismType (Mechanism subclass): if absent, Mechanism_Base.defaultMechanism is used
                        + entries with keys = standard args of Mechanism.__init__:

                                - each dict will be passed to the corresponding State
                                - params can be any permissible executeParamSpecs for the corresponding State

                                         entry will be passed to all of the State's projections, and used by
                                         by their execute methods, overriding their paramInstanceDefaults for that call
                                    + kwMappingParams:<dict>:
                                         entry will be passed to all of the State's Mapping projections,

                                         entry will be passed to all of the State's ControlSignal projections,

                                         along with any in the kwProjectionParams and Mapping or ControlSignal dicts

        - name (str): if it is not specified, a default based on the class is assigned in register_category,
                            of the form: className+n where n is the n'th instantiation of the class
        - prefs (PreferenceSet or specification dict):
             if it is omitted, a PreferenceSet will be constructed using the classPreferences for the subclass
             dict entries must have a preference keyPath as their key, and a PreferenceEntry or setting as their value
             (see Description under PreferenceSet for details)
        - context (str): used to track object/class assignments and methods in hierarchy

        NOTES:
            * if no configuration or time_scale is provided:
                a single mechanism of Mechanism class default mechanism and TRIAL are used
            * process.input is set to the inputState.value of the first mechanism in the configuration
            * process.output is set to the outputState.value of the last mechanism in the configuration

    ProcessRegistry:
        All Processes are registered in ProcessRegistry, which maintains a dict for the subclass,
          a count for all instances of it, and a dictionary of those instances

    Naming:
        Processes can be named explicitly (using the name='<name>' argument).  If this argument is omitted,
        it will be assigned "Mapping" with a hyphenated, indexed suffix ('Mapping-n')

    Execution:
        - Process.execute calls mechanism.update_states_and_execute for each mechanism in its configuration in sequence
            - input specified as arg in execution of Process is provided as input to first mechanism in configuration
            -Â output of last mechanism in configuration is assigned as Process.ouputState.value
            - DefaultController is executed before execution of each mechanism in the configuration
            - notes:
                * the same mechanism can be listed more than once in a configuration, inducing recurrent processing
                * if it is the first mechanism, it will receive its input from the Process only once (first execution)
                [TBI: add option to allow input to be provided every time mechanism it executed]
            - Process.ouputState.value receives Mechanism.outputState.value of last mechanism in the configuration

            returns (responseState, accuracy)
        [TBI: - interrogate(): returns (responseState, accuracy)
        [TBI: -Â terminate(): terminates the process and returns output
        [TBI: - accuracy(target):
