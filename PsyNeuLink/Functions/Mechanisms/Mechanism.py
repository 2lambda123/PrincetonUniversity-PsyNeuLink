Overview
--------

Mechanisms are the core object type in PsyNeuLink.  A mechanism takes an input, transforms it in some way, and provides
it as an output that can be used for some purpose  There are three types of mechanisms that serve different purposes:

* **ProcessingMechanisms** [LINK]
  aggregrate the input they receive from other mechanisms in a process or system, and/or the input to a process or
  system, transform it in some way, and provide the result either as input for other mechanisms and/or the output of a
  process or system.

* **MonitoringMechanisms** [LINK]
  monitor the output of one or more other mechanisms, receive training (target) values, and compare these to generate
  error signals used for learning [LINK].

* **ControlMechanisms** [LINK]
  evaluate the output of one or more other mechanisms, and use this to modify the parameters of those or other
  mechanisms.


COMMENT:
  MOVE TO ProcessingMechanisms overview:
  Different ProcessingMechanisms transform their input in different ways, and some allow this to be customized
  by modifying their ``function`` [LINK].  For example, a ``Transfer`` mechanism can be configured to produce a
  linear, logistic, or exponential transform of its input.
COMMENT

A mechanism is made up of two fundamental components: the function it uses to transform its input; and the states it
uses to represent its input, function parameters, and output

Function
--------

The core of every mechanism is its function, which transforms its input and generates its output.  The function is
specified by the mechanism's ``function`` parameter.  Each type of mechanism specifies one or more functions to use,
and generally these are from the Utility class [LINK] of functions provided by PsyNeuLink.  Functions are specified
in the same form that an object is instantiated in Python (by calling its __init__ method), and thus can be used to
specify its parameters.  For example, for a Transfer mechanism, if the Logistic function is selected, then its gain
and bias parameters can also be specified as shown in the following example::

    my_mechanism = Transfer(function=Logistic(gain=1.0, bias=-4))

While every mechanism type offers a standard set of functions, a custom function can also be specified.  Custom
functions can be any Python function, including an inline (lambda) function, so long as it generates a type of result
that is consistent with the mechanism's type [LINK].

The input to a mechanism's function is contained in the mechanism's ``variable`` attribute, and the result of its
function is contained in the mechanism's ``value`` attribute.

.. note::
   The input to a mechanism is not necessarily the same as the input to its function (i.e., its ``variable`` attribute);
   the mechanism's input is processed by its ``inputState(s)`` before being submitted to its function (see InputStates
   below) [LINK].  Similarly, the result of a mechanism's function (i.e., its ``value`` attribute)  is not necessarily
   the same as the mechanism's output;  the result of the function is processed by the mechanism's ``outputstate(s)``
   which is then assigned to the mechanism's ``outputValue`` attribute (see OutputStates below)[LINK]

States
------

Every mechanism has three types of states:

* **InputStates** [LINK] represent the input(s) to a mechanism.  Generally a mechanism has only one InputState,
  stored in its ``inputState`` attribute.  However some mechs have more than one...

AGGREGATION OF INPUTS
STATE'S FUNCTION (USUALLY COMBINATION FUNCTION)
INPUTSTATE.VARIABLE:  INPUT TO INPUTSTATE
INPUTSTATE.VALUE: OUTPUT OF INPUTSTATE'S FUNCTION,
    INPUT TO MECHANISM'S FUNCTION (MECHANISM.VARIABLE),
    AND == INPUTVALUE??
USUALLY JUST ONE (PRIMARY), BUT CAN BE SEVERAL INPUTSTATES (E.G. COMPARATOR MECHANISM)

* **ParameterStates** [LINK] represent the parameters of a mechanism's function.

* **OutputStates** [LINK] represent the output(s) of a mechainsm.

STATE'S FUNCTION (USUALLY IDENTITY FUNCTION (LINEAR TRANSFER WITH SLOPE = 1 AND INTERCEPT = 0)
OUTPUTSTATE.VARIABLE:  OUTPUT OF MECHANISMS' FUNCTION, INPUT TO OUTPUTSTATE'S FUNCTION
OUTPUTSTATE.VALUE: OUTPUT OF OUTPUTSTATE'S FUNCTION, AND == OUTPUT VALUE OF MECHANISM
USUALLY JUST ONE (PRIMARY), BUT CAN BE SEVERAL OUTPUTSTATES
    (E.G. CONTROL MECHANISM:  ONE FOR EACH PARAMETER CONTROLLED,
     OR FOR DDM THAT CONTAINS DIFFERENT PROPERTIES OF THE OUTPUT)

Custom Mechanisms
-----------------




Mechanism specification (from Process):
                    + Mechanism object
                    + Mechanism type (class) (e.g., DDM)
                    + descriptor keyword for a Mechanism type (e.g., kwDDM)
                    + specification dict for Mechanism; the dict can have the following entries (see Mechanism):
                        + kwMechanismType (Mechanism subclass): if absent, Mechanism_Base.defaultMechanism is used
                        + entries with keys = standard args of Mechanism.__init__:
                            "input_template":<value>

                    Notes:

                         (i.e., its paramInstanceDefaults), but NOT its execution;
                    * runtime params can be passed to the Mechanism (and its states and projections) using a tuple:
                        + (Mechanism, dict):
                            Mechanism can be any of the above

                                - params can be any permissible executeParamSpecs for the corresponding State
                                - dicts can contain the following embedded dicts:

                                         entry will be passed to all of the State's projections, and used by

    Description:
        Mechanisms are used as part of a pathway (together with projections) to execute a process
        A mechanism is associated with a name, a set of states, an update_and_execute method, and an execute method:
        - one or more inputStates:
            the value of each represents the aggregated input from its incoming mapping projections, and is used as
            the corresponding item in the variable of the mechanism's execute method
            * Note:
                by default, a Mechanism has only one inputState, assigned to <mechanism>.inputState;  however:
                if the specification of the Mechanism's variable is a list of arrays (lists), or
                if params[kwinputStates] is a list (of names) or a specification dict (of InputState specs),
                    <mechanism>.inputStates (note plural) is created and contains a dict of inputStates,
                    the first of which points to <mechanism>.inputState (note singular)
        - a set of parameters, each of which must be (or resolve to) a reference to a ParameterState
            these determine the operation of the mechanism's execute method
        - one or more outputStates:
            the variable of each receives the corresponding item in the output of the mechanism's execute method
            the value of each is passed to corresponding mapping projections for which the mechanism is a sender
            Notes:
            * by default, a Mechanism has only one outputState, assigned to <mechanism>.outputState;  however:
                  if params[kwOutputStates] is a list (of names) or specification dict (of MechanismOuput State specs),
                  <mechanism>.outputStates (note plural) is created and contains a dict of outputStates,
                  the first of which points to <mechanism>.outputState (note singular)
            [TBI * each outputState maintains a list of projections for which it serves as the sender]

        - an update_states_and_execute method:
            coordinates updating of inputs, params and execution of mechanism's execute method (implemented by subclass)
        Constraints:
            - the number of inputStates must correspond to the length of the variable of the mechanism's execute method
            - the value of each inputState must be compatible with the corresponding item in the
                variable of the mechanism's execute method
            - the value of each parameterState must be compatible with the corresponding parameter of  the mechanism's
                 execute method
            - the number of outputStates must correspond to the length of the output of the mechanism's execute method,
                (self.value)
            - the value of each outputState must be compatible with the corresponding item of the self.value
                 (the output of the mechanism's execute method)
    Subclasses:
        The implemented subclasses are:
            - DefaultProcessingMechanism_Base (used for SystemDefaultInputMechanism and SystemDefaultOutputMechanism)
            - DDM (default Mechanism)
            - DefaultControlMechanism (used for DefaultController)

    Instantiation:
        Mechanisms should NEVER be instantiated by a direct call to the class
        A Mechanism can be instantiated in one of several ways:
        - by calling the mechanism() module factory method, which instantiates the default mechanism (currently DDM)
            - the nth instance created will be named using the following format: functionType-n
        - by calling mechanism(name, params):
            - if name is the name of a mechanism class in the MechanismRegistry dictionary, it will be instantiated;
                otherwise, the default mechanism will be instantiated with that name
            - params (optional) must be a dictionary with parameter values relevant to the class invoked (see below)
        - by calling a subclass directly (e.g., DDM(name, params)); the name will be assigned to the instance
        - any parameters included in the initialization will be used as defaults for all calls to the mechanism
        - whenever a new subclass is instantiated (either through import or by one of the methods above),
            it is registered in the MechanismRegistry, which keeps a record of the subClass and instanceCount

    Initialization arguments:
        - variable:  establishes type of variable for the execute method, and initializes it (default: ??)
        - params (dict): (see _validate_params below and State.instantiate_state() for details)
            + kwInputState (value, list, dict):
                if param is absent:
                   a default InputState will be instantiated using variable of mechanism's execute method (EMV)
                    it will be placed as the single entry in an OrderedDict
                if param is a single value:
                    it will (if necessary) be instantiated and placed as the single entry in an OrderedDict
                if param is a list:
                    each item will (if necessary) be instantiated and placed as the single entry in an OrderedDict
                if param is an OrderedDict:
                    each entry will (if necessary) be instantiated as a InputState
                in each case, the result will be an OrderedDict of one or more entries:
                    the key for the entry will be the name of the inputState if provided, otherwise
                        kwInputStates-n will used (with n incremented for each entry)
                    the value of the inputState in each entry will be used as the corresponding value of the EMV
                    the dict will be assigned to both self.inputStates and paramsCurrent[kwInputState]
                    self.inputState will be pointed to self.inputStates[0] (the first entry of the dict)
                notes:
                    * if there is only one inputState, but the EMV has more than one item, it is assigned to the
                        the sole inputState, which is assumed to have a multi-item value
                    * if there is more than one inputState, number must match length of EMV, or an exception is raised
                specification of the param value, list item, or dict enrty value can be any of the following,
                    as long as it is compatible with the variable of the mechanism's execute method (EMV):
                    + InputState class: default will be instantiated using EMV as its value
                    + InputState object: its value must be compatible with EMV
                    + Projection subclass ref:
                        default InputState will be instantiated using EMV as its value
                        default projection (for InputState) will be instantiated using EMV as its variable
                            and assigned to InputState
                    + Projection object:
                        InputState will be instantiated using output of projection as its value;
                        this must be compatible with EMV
                    + specification dict:  InputState will be instantiated using EMV as its value;
                        must contain the following entries: (see Initialization arguments for State):
                            + FUNCTION (method)
                            + FUNCTION_PARAMS (dict)
                            + STATE_PROJECTIONS (Projection, specifications dict, or list of either of these)
                    + ParamValueProjection:
                        value will be used as variable to instantiate a default InputState
                        projection will be assigned as projection to InputState
                    + value: will be used as variable to instantiate a default InputState
                * note: inputStates can also be added using State.instantiate_state()
            + FUNCTION:(method):  method used to transform mechanism input to its output;
                this must be implemented by the subclass, or an exception will be raised
                each item in the variable of this method must be compatible with the corresponding InputState
                each item in the output of this method must be compatible  with the corresponding OutputState
                for any parameter of the method that has been assigned a ParameterState,
                    the output of the parameter state's own execute method must be compatible with
                    the value of the parameter with the same name in paramsCurrent[FUNCTION_PARAMS] (EMP)
            + FUNCTION_PARAMS (dict):
                if param is absent, no parameterStates will be created
                if present, each entry will (if necessary) be instantiated as a ParameterState,
                    and the resulting dict will be placed in <mechanism>.parameterStates
                the value of each entry can be any of those below, as long as it resolves to a value that is
                    compatible with param of the same name in <mechanism>.paramsCurrent[FUNCTION_PARAMS] (EMP)
                    + ParameterState class ref: default will be instantiated using param with same name in EMP
                    + ParameterState object: its value must be compatible with param of same name in EMP
                    + Projection subclass ref:
                        default ParameterState will be instantiated using EMP
                        default projection (for ParameterState) will be instantiated using EMP
                            and assigned to ParameterState
                    + Projection object:
                        ParameterState will be instantiated using output of projection as its value;
                        this must be compatible with EMP
                    + specification dict:  ParameterState will be instantiated using EMP as its value;
                        must contain the following entries: (see Instantiation arguments for ParameterState):
                            + FUNCTION (method)
                            + FUNCTION_PARAMS (dict)
                            + STATE_PROJECTIONS (Projection, specifications dict, or list of either of these)
                    + ParamValueProjection tuple:

                this specification overrides (for this Mechanism) any in the ControlMechanism or System params[]
                this is overridden if None is specified for MONITORED_OUTPUT_STATES in the outputState itself
                each item must be one of the following:

                        + weight (int): will be used to multiplicative weight outState.value when computing EVC
                    + MonitoredOutputStatesOption (AutoNumber enum): (note: ignored if one of the above is specified)

                        + ALL_OUTPUT_STATES:  monitor all of the outputStates of the Mechanism
                    + Mechanism (object): ignored (used for SystemController and System params)

             dict entries must have a preference keyPath as their key, and a PreferenceEntry or setting as their value
             (see Description under PreferenceSet for details)
        - context (str): must be a reference to a subclass, or an exception will be raised

    MechanismRegistry:
        All Mechanisms are registered in MechanismRegistry, which maintains a dict for each subclass,
          a count for all instances of that type, and a dictionary of those instances

    Naming:
        Mechanisms can be named explicitly (using the name='<name>' argument).  If the argument is omitted,
        it will be assigned the subclass name with a hyphenated, indexed suffix ('subclass.name-n')

    Class attributes:

        + className = functionCategory
        + suffix = " <className>"

        + paramNames (dict)
        + defaultMechanism (str): Currently kwDDM (class reference resolved in __init__.py)

    Class methods:
        - _validate_variable(variable, context)
        - _validate_params(request_set, target_set, context)
        - update_states_and_execute(time_scale, params, context):
            updates input, param values, executes <subclass>.function, returns outputState.value
        - terminate_execute(self, context=None): terminates execution of mechanism (for TimeScale = time_step)
        -Â adjust(params, context)
            modifies specified mechanism params (by calling Function.assign_defaults)
            returns output
            # parses, validates and assigns validated control signal (called by __init__() and adjust() class methods)

    Instance attributes (implemented in __init__():
        + variable (value): used as input to mechanism's execute method
        + paramsCurrent (dict): current value of all params for instance (created and validated in Functions init)
        + paramInstanceDefaults (dict): defaults for instance (created and validated in Functions init)
        + paramNames (list): list of keys for the params in paramInstanceDefaults
        + inputState (InputState): default MechanismInput object for mechanism

        + receivesProcessInput (bool): flags if Mechanism (as first in Pathway) receives Process input projection
        + parameterStates (dict): created if params[FUNCTION_PARAMS] specifies any parameters
        + outputState (OutputState): default OutputState for mechanism
        + outputStates (dict): created if params[kwOutputStates] specifies more than one OutputState
        + value (value, list, or ndarray): output of the Mechanism's execute method;
            Note: currently each item of self.value corresponds to value of corresponding outputState in outputStates
        + outputStateValueMapping (dict): specifies index of each state in outputStates,
            used in _update_output_states to assign the correct item of value to each outputState in outputStates
            Notes:
            * any Function with a function that returns a value with len > 1 MUST implement self.execute
            *    rather than just use the params[FUNCTION] so that outputStateValueMapping can be implemented
            * TBI: if the function of a Function is specified only by params[FUNCTION]
                       (i.e., it does not implement self.execute) and it returns a value with len > 1
                       it MUST also specify kwFunctionOutputStateValueMapping
        + phaseSpec (int or float): time_step(s) on which Mechanism.update() is called (see Process for specification)
        + stateRegistry (Registry): registry containing dicts for each state type (input, output and parameter)
            with instance dicts for the instances of each type and an instance count for each state type
            Note: registering instances of state types with the mechanism (rather than in the StateRegistry)
                  allows the same name to be used for instances of a state type belonging to different mechanisms
                  without adding index suffixes for that name across mechanisms
                  while still indexing multiple uses of the same base name within a mechanism
        + processes (dict):
            entry for each process to which the mechanism belongs; key = process; value = ORIGIN, INTERNAL, OR TERMINAL
            these are use
        + systems (dict):
            entry for each system to which the mechanism belongs; key = system; value = ORIGIN, INTERNAL, OR TERMINAL
        + name (str): if it is not specified as an arg, a default based on the class is assigned in register_category
        + prefs (PreferenceSet): if not specified as an arg, default is created by copying Mechanism_BasePreferenceSet

    Instance methods:
        The following method MUST be overridden by an implementation in the subclass:
        - execute:
            - called by update_states_and_execute()
            - must be implemented by Mechanism subclass, or an exception is raised
        - run:
            - calls run() function with mechanism as object
        - _assign_input:
            - called by execute() if call to execute was direct call (i.e., not from process or system) and with input
        - initialize:
            - called by system and process
            - assigns self.value and calls _update_output_states
        - _report_mechanism_execution(input, params, output)
