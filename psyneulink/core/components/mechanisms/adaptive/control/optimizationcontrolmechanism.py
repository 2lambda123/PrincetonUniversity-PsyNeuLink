Overview
--------

An OptimizationControlMechanism is an abstract class for subclasses of `ControlMechanism <ControlMechanism>` that
uses an `OptimizationFunction` to find an `allocation_policy <ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>` --Â 
a `variable <ControlSignal.variable>` for each of its `ControlSignals <ControlSignal>` -- that optimizes the
value of its `objective_function <OptimizationControlMechanism.objective_function>`.  The `objective_function 
<OptimizationControlMechanism.objective_function>` is used by the OptimizationControlMechanism's primary 
`function <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>` to determine the `Expected Value of Control (EVC) 
<OptimizationControlMechanisms_EVC>` for a given  `allocation_policy <ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>`. 
There are two broad types of OptimizationControlMechanisms, that can be described loosely as "model-free" and  
"model-based," based on how their `objective_function <OptimizationControlMechanism.objective_function>` determines 
the EVC.

.. _OptimizationControlMechanism_Model_Free:

*Model Free OptimizationControlMechanisms*

OptimizationControlMechanism that are model-free use a `learning_function
<OptimizationControlMechanism_Learning_Function>` to generate a set of `prediction_weights
<OptimizationControlMechanism.prediction_weights>` that can predict, for the current state, 
the `outcome <ControlMechanism.outcome>` resulting from different allocation_policies.  The current state is 
represented in a `prediction_vector <OptimizationControlMechanism.prediction_vector>`.  In each trial, 
the `learning_function <OptimizationControlMechanism.learning_function>` updates the 
`prediction_weights <OptimizationControlMechanism.prediction_weights>` based on the `prediction_vector 
<OptimizationControlMechanism.prediction_vector>` and the `outcome <ControlMechanism.outcome>` for the 
previous trial.  The updated weights can be used by the `objective_function  
<OptimizationControlMechanism.objective_function>` to predict the EVC for the current `prediction_vector 
<OptimizationControlMechanism.prediction_vector>` and a given `allocation_policy 
<ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>`  The OptimizationControlMechainsm's primary `function 
<OptimizationControlMechanism.function>` exploits this to find the `allocation_policy 
<ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>` that yields the *best* EVC for the current `prediction_vector 
<OptimizationControlMechanism.prediction_vector>`, and then implements that for the next `trial` of execution.  

.. _OptimizationControlMechanism_Model_Free:

*Model-Based OptimizationControlMechanisms*

OptimizationControlMechanisms that are model-based are called `controllers <Composition.controllers>`.   These use the  
`ModelBasedControlMechanism` subclass, that has a `run_simulation <ModelBasedControlMechanism.run_simulation>` method.  
Their `objective_function <OptimizationControlMechanism.objective_function>` uses this to empirically determine the 
`EVC <OptimizationControlMechanisms_EVC>` for a given `allocation_policy 
<ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>`, by running one or more simulations of the `Composition` to which 
the ModelBasedControlMechanism belongs. ModelBasedControlMechanisms may or may not also use a `learning_function 
<OptimizationControlMechanism_Learning_Function>` in combination with their `run_simulation 
<ModelBasedControlMechanism.run_simulation>` method (e.g., for efficiency, or to handle factors that influence
`outcome <ControlMechanism.outcome>` and/or `costs <ControlMechanism.costs>` in different ways).  Like model-free 
OptimizationControlMechanisms, their `function <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>` uses `objective_function 
<OptimizationControlMechanism.objective_function` to identify the `allocation_policy 
<ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>` that yields the greatest EVC, and then implement that for the next 
`trial` of execution.
  
.. _OptimizationControlMechanisms_EVC:

All OptimizationControlMechanisms seek to maximize their Expected Value of Control (EVC) --  a cost-benefit analysis 
that weighs the `cost <ControlSignal.cost> of its `control_signals` for an `allocation_policy 
<ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>` against the `outcome <OptimizationControlMechanism.outcome>` 
resulting from that policy.  The EVC for an `allocation_policy <ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>`
is computed by `objective_function <OptimizationControlMechanism.objective_function>` using the 
OptimizationControlMechanism's `compute_EVC <OptimizationControlMechanism.compute_EVC>` method and some combination
of its `outcome <OptimizationControlMechanism.outcome>`, `costs` attribute, and current `predicition_vector
<OptimizationControlMechanism.prediction_vector>` attributes, depending on whether it is model-free or model-based 
and the particular subclass.

.. _OptimizationControlMechanism_Creation:

Creating an OptimizationControlMechanism
----------------------------------------

An OptimizationControlMechanism can be created in the same was as any `ControlMechanism <ControlMechanism>`.  The only
constraint is that an `OptimizationFunction` (or one that has the same structure) must be specified as the **function**
argument of its constructor.  In addition, a **learning_function** can be specified (see `below
<OptimizationControlMechanism_Learning_Function>`)

.. _OptimizationControlMechanism_Structure:

Structure
---------

An OptimizationControlMechanism has the same structure as a `ControlMechanism`, including a `Projection <Projection>`
to its *OUTCOME* InputState from its `objective_mechanism <ControlMechanism.objective_mechanism>`.  In
addition to its primary `function <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>`, it may also have a `learning_function
<OptimizationControlMechanism.learning_function>`, both of which are described below.

.. _OptimizationControlMechanism_Learning_Function:

Learning Function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An OptimizationControlMechanism may have a `learning_function <OptimizationControlMechanism.learning_function>`
used to generate a model that attempts to predict the value of its `objective_function
<OptimizationControlMechanism.objective_function>` for a given `allocation_policy <ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>`
from a `prediction_vector <OptimizationControlMechanism.prediction_vector>`; it is up to the subclass of the
OptimizationControlMechanism to determine the contents of `prediction_vector
<OptimizationControlMechanism.prediction_vector>`, as well as the `objective_function
<OptimizationControlMechanism.objective_function>`. The `learning_function
<OptimizationControlMechanism.learning_function>` takes as its first argument the `prediction_vector
<OptimizationControlMechanism.prediction_vector>`), and as its second argument the value of it seeks to predict
(typically, the OptimizationControlMechanism's `net_oucome <OptimizationControlMechanism.net_outcome>` attribute.
It returns an array with one weight for each element of `prediction_vector
<OptimizationControlMechanism.prediction_vector>`, that is assigned as the OptimizationControlMechanism's
`prediction_weights <OptimizationControlMechanism.prediction_weights>`) attribute.  This is can be used by its
primary `function <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>` in seeking an `allocation_policy
<ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>` that yields the best value of the `objective_function
<OptimizationControlMechanism.objective_function>` (see `below <OptimizationControlMechanism_Function>).

.. _OptimizationControlMechanism_Function:

*Primary Function*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `function <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>` of an OptimizationControlMechanism is generally an
`OptimizationFunction`, which in turn has `objective_function <OptimizationFunction.objective_function>`,
`search_function <OptimizationFunction.search_function>` and `search_termination_function
<OptimizationFunction.search_termination_function>` methods, as well as a `search_space
<OptimizationFunction.search_space>` attribute.  The `objective_function <OptimizationFunction.objective_function>`
is used to evaluate each `allocation_policy <ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>` generated by the `search_function
<OptimizationFunction.search_function>`, and return the one that yields the greatest `EVC 
<OptimizationControlMechanism_EVC>` based on the `compute_EVC <OptimizationControlMechanism.compute_EVC>` method.

An OptimizationControlMechanism must implement an `objective_function <OptimizationControlMechanism>` method that
is passed to the `OptimizationFunction` as its `objective_function <OptimizationFunction.objective_function>` parameter.
The OptimizationControlMechanism may also implement `search_function <OptimizationControlMechanism.search_function>`
and `search_termination_function <OptimizationControlMechanism.search_termination_function>` methods, as well as a
`search_space <OptimizationControlMechanism.search_space>` attribute, that will also be passed as parameters to the
`OptimizationFunction` when it is constructed.  Any or all of these assignments can be overriden by specifying the
relevant parameters in a constructor for the `OptimizationFunction` assigned as the **function** argument of the
OptimizationControlMechanism's constructor, as long as they are compatible with the requirements of the
OptimizationFunction and OptimizationControlMechanism.  A custom function can also be assigned as the `function
<OptimizationControlMechanism.function>` of an OptimizationControlMechanism, however it must meet the following
requirements:

.. _OptimizationControlMechanism_Custom_Funtion:

    - it must accept as its first argument and return as its result an array with the same shape as the
      OptimizationControlMechanism's `allocation_policy <ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>`.

    - it must implement a :method:`reinitialize` method that accepts as keyword arguments **objective_function**,
      **search_function**, **search_termination_function**, and **search_space**, and implement attributes
      with corresponding names.

.. _OptimizationControlMechanism_Execution:

Execution
---------

When an OptimizationControlMechanism executes, it calls its `learning_function
<OptimizationControlMechanism.learning_function>` if it has one, to udpate its `prediction_weights 
OptimizationControlMechanism.prediction_weights>`. It then calls its primary `function 
<OptimizationControlMechanism.function>` to find the `allocation_policy <ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>` that 
yields the greatest `EVC <OptimizationControlMechanism_EVC>`.  The `function <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>` 
does this by selecting a sample `allocation_policy <ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>` (usually using  
`search_function <OptimizationControlMechanism.search_function>` to select one from `control_signal_search_space 
<OptimizationControlMechanism.control_signal_search_space>`, and evaluating the EVC for that `allocation_policy 
<ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>` using the `objective_function <OptimizationControlMechanism.objective_function>`.
The latter does so either by using the current `prediction_vector OptimizationControlMechanism.prediction_vector` and
`prediction_weights <OptimizationControlMechanism.prediction_weights>` to predict the EVC (model-free
OptimizationControlMechanisms), or by calling the OptimizationControlMechanism's `run_simulation
<ModelBasedControlMechanism.run_simulation>` to "empirically" generate the `outcome
<OptimizationControlMechanism.outcome>` for the `allocation_policy <ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>` and then
evaluting the EVC for the resulting `outcome <OptimizationControlMechanism.outcome>` and `costs
<OptimizationControlMechanism.costs>` (model-based `controller <Composition.controller>`\\s).  In either case, one or
more allocation_policies are evaluated, and the one that yields the greatest EVC is returned.  The values of that
`allocation_policy <ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>` are assigned as the `variables <ControlSignal.variable>` of
its `control_signals <ControlMechanism.control_signals>`, from which they compute their `values <ControlSignal.value>`.

    Subclass of `ControlMechanism <ControlMechanism>` that adjusts its `ControlSignals <ControlSignal>` to optimize
    performance of the `Composition` to which it belongs

    Arguments
    ---------

    objective_mechanism : ObjectiveMechanism or List[OutputState specification]
        specifies either an `ObjectiveMechanism` to use for the OptimizationControlMechanism, or a list of the 
        `OutputState <OutputState>`\\s it should monitor; if a list of `OutputState specifications
        <ObjectiveMechanism_Monitored_Output_States>` is used, a default ObjectiveMechanism is created and the list
        is passed to its **monitored_output_states** argument.

    learning_function : LearningFunction, function or method
        specifies a function used to learn to predict the `EVC <OptimizationControlMechanism_EVC>` from
        the current `prediction_vector <OptimizationControlMechanism.prediction_vector>` (see
        `OptimizationControlMechanism_Learning_Function` for details).

    objective_function : function or method
        specifies the function used to evaluate the `EVC <OptimizationControlMechanism_EVC>` for a given
        `allocation_policy <ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>`. It is assigned as the `objective_function 
        <OptimizationFunction.objective_function>` parameter of `function  <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>`, 
        unless that is specified in the constructor for an  OptimizationFunction assigned to the **function** 
        argument of the OptimizationControlMechanism's constructor.  Often it is assigned directy to the 
        OptimizationControlMechanism's `compute_EVC <OptimizationControlMechanism.compute_EVC>` method;  in some 
        cases it may implement additional operations, but should always call `compute_EVC 
        <OptimizationControlMechanism.compute_EVC>`. A custom function can be assigned, but it must take as its 
        first argument an array with the same shape as the OptimizationControlMechanism's `allocation_policy 
        <ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>`, and return the following four values: an array containing the 
        `allocation_policy <ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>` that generated the optimal EVC 
        <OptimizationControlMechanism_EVC>; an array containing that EVC value;  a list containing each 
        `allocation_policy <ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>` sampled if `function 
        <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>` has a `save_samples <OptimizationFunction.save_samples>` attribute 
        and it is `True`, otherwise it should return an empty list; and a list containing the EVC values for each 
        `allocation_policy <ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>` sampled if the function has a `save_values 
        <OptimizationFunction.save_values>` attribute and it is `True`, otherwise it should return an empty list.

    search_function : function or method
        specifies the function assigned to `function <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>` as its 
        `search_function <OptimizationFunction.search_function>` parameter, unless that is specified in a 
        constructor for `function <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>`.  It must take as its arguments 
        an array with the same shape as `allocation_policy <ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>` and an integer
        (indicating the iteration of the `optimization process <OptimizationFunction_Process>`), and return 
        an array with the same shape as `allocation_policy <ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>`.

    search_termination_function : function or method
        specifies the function assigned to `function <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>` as its 
        `search_termination_function <OptimizationFunction.search_termination_function>` parameter, unless that is 
        specified in a constructor for `function <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>`.  It must take as its 
        arguments an array with the same shape as `allocation_policy <ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>` and two 
        integers (the first representing the `EVC <OptimizationControlMechanism_EVC>` value for the current 
        `allocation_policy <ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>`, and the second the current iteration of the 
        `optimization process <OptimizationFunction_Process>`;  it must return `True` or `False`.
        
    search_space : list or ndarray
        specifies the `search_space <OptimizationFunction.search_space>` parameter for `function 
        <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>`, unless that is specified in a constructor for `function 
        <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>`.  Each item must have the same shape as `allocation_policy 
        <ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>`.
        
    function : OptimizationFunction, function or method
        specifies the function used to optimize the `allocation_policy <ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>`;  
        must take as its sole argument an array with the same shape as `allocation_policy 
        <ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>`, and return a similar array (see `Primary Function 
        <OptimizationControlMechanism>` for additional details).

    params : Dict[param keyword: param value] : default None
        a `parameter dictionary <ParameterState_Specification>` that can be used to specify the parameters for the
        Mechanism, its `learning_function <OptimizationControlMechanism.learning_function>`, and/or a custom function and its parameters.  Values
        specified for parameters in the dictionary override any assigned to those parameters in arguments of the
        constructor.

    name : str : default see `name <OptimizationControlMechanism.name>`
        specifies the name of the OptimizationControlMechanism.

    prefs : PreferenceSet or specification dict : default Mechanism.classPreferences
        specifies the `PreferenceSet` for the OptimizationControlMechanism; see `prefs
        <OptimizationControlMechanism.prefs>` for details.

        by `learning_function <OptimizationControlMechanism.learning_function>`.

    learning_function : LearningFunction, function or method
        takes `prediction_vector <OptimizationControlMechanism.prediction_vector>` as its first argument, and 
        `net_outcome <ControlMechanism.net_outcome>` as its second argument, and returns an updated set of 
        `prediction_weights <OptimizationControlMechanism.prediction_weights>` (see  
        `OptimizationControlMechanism_Learning_Function` for additional details).

    function : OptimizationFunction, function or method
        takes current `allocation_policy <ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>` (as initializer),
        evaluates samples of `allocation_policy <ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>`, and returns 
        the one that yields the greatest EVC <OptimizationControlMechanism_EVC>`  (see 
        `Primary Function  <OptimizationControlMechanism_Function>` for additional details).

    objective_function : function or method
        `objective_function <OptimizationFunction.objective_function>` assigned to `function 
        <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>`;  often this is simply the OptimizationControlMechanism's
        `compute_EVC <OptimizationControlMechanism.compute_EVC>` method, but it should always call that.  
        
    search_function : function or method

        `optimization process <OptimizationFunction_Process>`.
        
    search_space : list or ndarray
        `search_space <OptimizationFunction.search_space>` assigned to `function 
        <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>`;  determines the samples of 
        `allocation_policy <ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>` evaluated by the `objective_function 
        <OptimizationControlMechanism.objective_function>`.

    saved_samples : list
        contains all values of `allocation_policy <ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>` sampled by `function
        <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>` if its `save_samples <OptimizationFunction.save_samples>` parameter
        is `True`;  otherwise list is empty.

    saved_values : list
        contains values of EVC associated with all samples of `allocation_policy <ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>` 
         evaluated by by `function <OptimizationControlMechanism.function>` if its `save_values 
         <OptimizationFunction.save_samples>` parameter is `True`;  otherwise list is empty.

    name : str
        name of the OptimizationControlMechanism; if it is not specified in the **name** argument of the constructor, a
        default is assigned by MechanismRegistry (see `Naming` for conventions used for default and duplicate names).

    prefs : PreferenceSet or specification dict
        the `PreferenceSet` for the OptimizationControlMechanism; if it is not specified in the **prefs** argument of
        the constructor, a default is assigned using `classPreferences` defined in __init__.py (see :doc:`PreferenceSet
        <LINK>` for details).
