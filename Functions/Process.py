    Description:
        A Process is defined by a kwConfiguration param (list of Mechanisms) and a time scale.  Executing a Process
         executes the Mechanisms in the order that they appear in the configuration.

    Instantiation:
        A Process can be instantiated in one of two ways:
            - by a direct call to Process()
            [TBI: - in a list to a call to System()]
        A Process instantiates its configuration by assigning:
            - a projection from the Process to the inputState of the first mechanism in the configuration
            - a projection from each mechanism in the list to the next (if one is not already specified)
            - any params specified as part of a (mechanism, params) tuple in the configuration
            - Process.outputState to Mechanism.outputState of the last mechanism in the configuration

    Initialization arguments:
        - input (value): used as input to first Mechanism in Configuration (default: first mech variableInstanceDefault)
            ProcessInputState is instantiated to represent each item in the input, and generate a mapping projection
                for it to the first Mechanism in the Configuration:
                if len(Process.input) == len(Mechanism.variable):
                    - create one projection for each of the Mechanism.inputState(s)
                if len(Process.input) == 1 but len(Mechanism.variable) > 1:
                    - create a projection for each of the Mechanism.inputStates, and provide Process.input.value to each
                if len(Process.input) > 1 but len(Mechanism.variable) == 1:
                    - create one projection for each Process.input value and assign all to Mechanism.inputState
                otherwise,  if len(Process.input) != len(Mechanism.variable) and both > 1:
                    - raise exception:  ambiguous mapping from Process input values to first Mechanism's inputStates
        - params (dict):

            kwConfiguration (list): (default: single Mechanism_Base.defaultMechanism)
                Each config_entry must be one of the following, that is used to instantiate the mechanisms in the list:
                    + Mechanism object
                    + Mechanism type (class) (e.g., DDM)
                    + descriptor keyword for a Mechanism type (e.g., kwDDM)
                    + specification dict for Mechanism; the dict can have the following entries (see Mechanism):
                        + kwMechanismType (Mechanism subclass): if absent, Mechanism_Base.defaultMechanism is used
                        + entries with keys = standard args of Mechanism.__init__:
                            "input_template":<value>

                                         entry will be passed to all of the State's projections, and used by

                                    + kwMappingParams:<dict>:

        - name (str): if it is not specified, a default based on the class is assigned in register_category,
                            of the form: className+n where n is the n'th instantiation of the class
        - prefs (PreferenceSet or specification dict):
             if it is omitted, a PreferenceSet will be constructed using the classPreferences for the subclass
             dict entries must have a preference keyPath as their key, and a PreferenceEntry or setting as their value
             (see Description under PreferenceSet for details)
        - context (str): used to track object/class assignments and methods in hierarchy

        NOTES:
            * if no configuration or time_scale is provided:
                a single mechanism of Mechanism class default mechanism and TRIAL are used
            * process.input is set to the inputState.value of the first mechanism in the configuration
            * process.output is set to the outputState.value of the last mechanism in the configuration

    ProcessRegistry:
        All Processes are registered in ProcessRegistry, which maintains a dict for the subclass,
          a count for all instances of it, and a dictionary of those instances

    Naming:
        Processes can be named explicitly (using the name='<name>' argument).  If this argument is omitted,
        it will be assigned "Mapping" with a hyphenated, indexed suffix ('Mapping-n')

    Execution:
        - Process.execute calls mechanism.update_states_and_execute for each mechanism in its configuration in sequence
            â¢ input specified as arg in execution of Process is provided as input to first mechanism in configuration
            â¢Â output of last mechanism in configuration is assigned as Process.ouputState.value
            â¢ DefaultController is executed before execution of each mechanism in the configuration
            â¢ notes:
                * the same mechanism can be listed more than once in a configuration, inducing recurrent processing
                * if it is the first mechanism, it will receive its input from the Process only once (first execution)
                [TBI: add option to allow input to be provided every time mechanism it executed]
            â¢ Process.ouputState.value receives Mechanism.outputState.value of last mechanism in the configuration

            - subsequent Mechanisms:
                assign projections from each Mechanism to the next one in the list:
                - if Projection is explicitly specified as item between them in the list, use that;
                - if Projection is NOT explicitly specified,
                    but the next Mechanism already has a projection from the previous one, use that;
                - otherwise, instantiate a default Mapping projection from previous mechanism to next:
                    use kwIdentity (identity matrix) if len(sender.value == len(receiver.variable)
                    use kwFullConnectivityMatrix (full connectivity matrix with unit weights) if the lengths are not equal
